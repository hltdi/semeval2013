Submission Name: hltdi-l2

Approach:
----------

Short description of the approach:
Our "L2" model builds on the L1 model, but with the translations of the word of
interest into the four other target languages as additional features. At
training time, these translations are extracted from the training data used to
produce the L1 classifiers, and at testing time, the translations are estimated
using the L1 classifiers. So as in the work of Lefever and Hoste, our L2
classifiers make use of several aligned bitext corpora, but without relying on a
complete MT system.

Resources that were used:
The Europarl_Intersection corpus.

Tools that were used (preprocessing, machine learning tools, etc)
NLTK, Stanford Tagger, Berkeley Aligner, TreeTagger (for lemmatization), megam.
