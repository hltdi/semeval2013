both have many years experience in the manufacture and distribution of forest products .
1 .
another point i should like to discuss is the right of the supplier to choose his customers as he sees fit .
i am getting sick and tired of ministers who seem to have some hang - up with regard to the collective bargaining process .
there is just one specific item more that i would like to comment upon and then i will sit down , mr. speaker .
order , please .
3 .
i can refer him to no better authority on the subject than the hon. member for don valley , not just myself .
it is quite understandable .
in addition , it could become a serious threat to confederation and national unity .
in view of this , we deemed it inadvisable to attend the meeting and so informed cojo .
mr. speaker , the minister suggested that a greater building program might lead to inflationary pressure .
i disagree with the argument advanced by the minister .
there is a lot to be said on both sides of that question .
order .
mr. speaker , as i indicated to the leader of the opposition , i would hope to make an announcement on this question on november 1 .
quite right .

there is one other point i should like to make , and i do so as i feel this is a general debate .
in december there was an announcement that british columbia would be withdrawing from cema .
they have also given rise to considerable opposition by hon. members in all parties on this side of the house .
those are not the lines that one should be concerned about at this time .
i have allowed the hon. member two supplementaries and in fairness i think we should go to some other hon. members .
i think that is good .
i think that the time taken in handling routine applications for changes of facilities along a pipeline , for example , has been too long .
he is the minister who is responsible for science and technology , and he does not know .

6 .
i will be glad , when we have time , to sit down with hon. members and work this matter out on a productive and prospective basis .
will the minister take action to clear up any difficulties because of the absolute need for placing the orders now , and not some months from now ?
it will spur the construction of new fishing boats and cause new processing facilities to be built .
there are many things i could say about bill c - 19 .
i am going to say something a bit later on about that because i think it is essential to the kind of debate we are having this afternoon .
companies find that the rules are complicated , cumbersome and changing all the time .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister in charge of the canadian wheat board .
i understand that a rate of at least 70 per cent per annum is being contemplated .
it is our hope to make a decision this week .

this bill has been before the house for more than a year .
retired december 30 , 1975 following completion of 34 years of public service .
passage of the hon. member 's motion would mean that the content requirements are spelled out in the statute and we could debate them .
this does not necessarily indicate non - compliance on the part of the parties .

how can so much be asked , on the one hand , and so little answered on the other ?
as a result , perhaps he will bring in different legislation which will not lay him open to the charge of censorship .
either they do their job properly , or you must get the power so that you can be sure that they do it properly .

as much as i hate to admit it , there has been good legislation brought in by liberal governments in this country --
as the member for the neighbouring riding i am well aware of his persistence and hard work .
where is the aib ?
at the moment , that fact , unfortunately , is seen in two - thirds of the country not as an opportunity , but as a barrier to opportunity .
do not force a moratorium down our throats .
this not the first time that members of parliament are going to hear that .
the same recommendation was made in the report of the standing committee on privileges and elections on april 29 of last year .
mr. speaker , i am afraid the hon. member is ill informed .
in the mot accident report it is stated :

in most samples of this size -- that is , a group of over 500 -- this would be called negligible .
the traditional procedure for seeking new borrowing powers is to attach a clause to supply bills brought before the house .

i would add , mr. speaker , that it must be continued .
if i want any statistics as to where this country stands , certainly i will not refer to the speech made by the prime minister .

first , mr. speaker , i should like to make a few general remarks .
mr. chairman , i will see if there is such a figure available , but i would quarrel with the words of the hon. member .
i know he would not want to divert me from responding to a very serious question by his colleague .
continually we get the message from across the way that this program will cost the government something .
that is the crowd which did not like the 18 cents .
what is at issue here is the principle that the public of canada has a right to know about the constitution of canada .
they want to pick and choose what they will support .

the very result of unemployment breaks up families , and contributes to excessive alcohol and drug use .

i want to make it plain , mr. speaker , that the federal government does not set retail prices .

let me come now to petro - canada .

unfortunately , no one seems to know what the effect will be .
we have allowed a subgovernment across the country to remove power from the house of commons .

the chair is really embarrassed by what is taking place .
mr. speaker , i am sorry , i have not seen the statement by a british firm .

for debate , the hon. member for bow river -lrb- mr. taylor -rrb- .

there are two revolving - door syndrome and gating .
i hope he will be back with that mobilized public opinion .

the parliamentary subcommittee is considering the whole question of equality rights .
the fact is that no applications involving fewer than four student employees is being subjected to any test of whether or not the jobs are career oriented .
we also want a series of objective criteria based on factors such as those i am referring to .
if we proceed on that basis in this or in any other direction in public life , we will always be able to find excuses .
then you brought in your program , the hotel went down the tube and fort st. john became a ghost town .
well , in six months , we did consult , we sat down with the minister and hammered out an agreement .

i should like to put on the record just exactly what is in the notes on the financial statement of march 31 , 1984 .
that judgment is sent to the individual in question .
that does not make sense .
mr. speaker , many authorities were involved in acting on this emergency .
however , what happened to the studies that were conducted after that incident occurred ?

in other words , the writing is on the wall .
they were saying that homeowners would lose again because interest rates were rising .
our international role has somehow collapsed .
for instance , if we look at crop insurance , the federal government has put up half the premiums and the producers have put up the other half .
so we cannot think in those terms .
the minister has said that the only problem with candu and the whole nuclear power option is a marketing one .

specialty services such as stand - by supply vessels for the beaufort sea oil and gas industry can be provided by others .
unfortunately or fortunately , however one views the issue , that particular minister has not met with very much success .

production is being expanded with the development of a sixth farm at bowden institution in alberta .

may i therefore ask the hon. member to refrain from any further displays .
why did the prime minister appear prepared to disregard his promise in the first place ?
mr. speaker , i am always amused by these probing questions from the liberal party , the party which says that it would control the deficit .
surely the hon. member is not suggesting that we levy taxes on companies that have been losing money .
mr. speaker , the premise of the question put by the hon. member is wrong .
how many people are employed -lrb- a -rrb- directly or by contract -lrb- b -rrb- full time and part time , in the office of the prime minister ?
the fees paid to each performer were in keeping with the role played in the gala and with the standards of the union des artistes .
during the liberal administration nothing was done about it .
they know about the overproduction problem .

my task is to see to it that the rights and privileges of all of you parliamentarians of canada are protected .

speech from the throne
the speaker :
members of the house of commons ,
ladies and gentlemen :
as governor general i have visited every province and territory , and i wish every canadian could share that experience .
our cities , towns , and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country .
and yet our communities , whether on the coasts or the prairies , whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra , show the same friendliness , openness , and generosity .
people care for each other in many ways , and they give their time and their support to their community .
when i became governor general , i stated my intention to honor the generosity of canadians , especially as demonstrated by volunteers .
we have now created the caring canadian award to recognize the most dedicated among them .
in my functions , i visit with many units of the canadian forces .
they have impressed me with their dedication , as demonstrated by their peacekeeping role , their heroic work in search and rescue , and their immediate response to natural disasters such as the saguenay region and red river floods .
let me mention another source of great pride : the proclamation of the twenty - first of june , the longest day of the year , as national aboriginal day - a day to honor the first peoples of this land .
a new parliament -
today marks the opening of a new parliament , the last parliament of the 20 th century and the first parliament of the 21 st century , a parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for canadians .
on june 2 , 1997 , the people of canada renewed the mandate of the government .
over the course of this parliament , the government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform .
the parliament of canada is the only institution directly elected by all canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest .
elected by all canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this bestows , the government of canada will stand up for the shared values of canadians at home and abroad .
but governing in the 21 st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone .
given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy , collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of canada .
more than ever , canadians want their governments to work together in partnership .
as we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities , we can look back at the last century of canadian history and state with certainty that canada is rightly regarded , the world over , as an extraordinary success .
canada represents a triumph of the human spirit , bringing together the best of what people can do .
- for a new century of canadian achievement
as old and familiar constraints of time and distance are breaking down , individuals and communities can accomplish things once unimaginable .
canada is ready .
we are poised for success .
our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21 st century :
we have the values of sharing and mutual help .
we are well educated .
we welcome innovation and new ideas .
we are an open and democratic society .
we are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization .
we have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn them into strengths .
our federation makes the most of these talents .
it gives us the cohesion we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents , by pooling our resources and by sharing risks .
it also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world .
the government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional , non - partisan public service in a well - performing civil society .
canada is served well by its public service , and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society .
the government will continue to renew the public service of canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving canadians well .
we have already built a foundation for our success
in recent years , canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation ' s challenges .
we succeeded , and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium .
this 36 th parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances , and the economy is entering a period of strong growth .
while unemployment is still too high , hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created by the private sector , inflation is at very low levels , and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than three decades .
more canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before .
stimulating job creation and economic growth has been , remains , and will continue to be a major objective of the government of canada .
the government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence .
we will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment , to create new jobs , and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure canadians a stable and secure future .
the government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order :
it will put the debt - to - gdp ratio on a permanent downward track .
it will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998 - 99 .
it will introduce legislation to implement the proposed changes to the canada pension plan and the new seniors benefit in order to ensure canada ' s public pension system remains sustainable in the 21 st century .
one in three canadian jobs depend on trade .
our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities .
team canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate .
the government will build on this success with a focussed strategy , developed in consultation with industry , to improve our international economic performance by expanding canada ' s trade base , becoming the location of choice for global investment , and making canada a preferred tourist destination .
the government has regained the ability to address priorities of canadians while living within its means .
it is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities , and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation ' s finances .
the government is committed to following this balanced approach of social investment and prudent financial management as it leads canada toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social cohesion .
we are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of canadians across the country .
canadians feel better about their own future and the country ' s future .
we are looking to our future together with a new optimism .
the fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the years ahead and succeed .
our challenge for the future
our challenge is to ensure that no canadian is left behind as the country moves forward .
the future belongs to societies whose economy is sound ; who invest in knowledge , education and innovation ; whose population is healthy ; whose children are well prepared to learn ; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens .
canadians have already set these priorities for this new parliament .
these are the government ' s priorities .
building a stronger canada
the federal , provincial and territorial governments owe it to all canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country .
the single most important commitment of the government is to keep canada united .
the government of canada can have no greater duty or responsibility .
the overriding goal of the government of canada as we approach the 21 st century is both simple and ambitious .
it is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping canada one of the best places in the world in which to live .
realizing these aspirations fully will require the active engagement of canadians in all walks of life , as well as our institutions , businesses , voluntary organizations and our governments .
it will require collaboration and partnership .
it will require reaching out .
in their meeting last week , nine premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co - operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy .
the government welcomes the premiers ' and territorial leaders ' continuing interest in working together , and is committed to even closer collaboration on these important issues .
as a next step , the first ministers will meet this fall to work on co - operative approaches to address youth unemployment , health care and social policy renewal .
the government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity .
all its major initiatives will serve to make canada better and thus more united .
the government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in canadian society .
canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential .
we would all be forever diminished , forever changed , should we fail to maintain the example canada provides to the world .
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding .
therefore , the government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of canada .
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together .
most of all , it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart .
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine premiers and the territorial leaders last week in calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of quebec society .
we will build on the mutual respect canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future .
investing in children
a country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that is confident in its future .
a country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future .
one of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full potential .
we must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society .
while families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children , they are not alone .
it requires focussing on what children need to thrive .
the experiences of canada ' s children , especially in the early years , influence their health , their well - being , and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives .
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children , we improve the long - term health of our society .
addressing the needs of low - income families with children is therefore a priority of the government .
federal , provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co - operative way the problems of low - income families with children .
together we are now building the comprehensive and effective national child benefit system .
the government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning july 1 , 1998 .
the government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the canada child tax benefit by at least an additional $ 850 million during the course of this mandate .
the government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the national re - investment framework to guide the re - allocation of our partners ' savings into new services and benefits for low - income families with children .
we can make a difference in the lives of all our children .
children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development ; they need strong families ; they need safe , supportive communities .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments agreed in january 1997 to work together to develop the national children ' s agenda , a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of canada ' s children .
federal , provincial and territorial governments will work together to develop this broader agenda for children , including clear outcome measures by which to gauge success .
as part of this national agenda , the federal government will undertake three new initiatives :
it will establish centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs .
it will expand our aboriginal head start program onto reserves to ensure that all aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good start in life .
it will measure and report regularly on the readiness of canadian children to learn , so that we can assess our progress in providing our children with the best possible start .
investing in quality care and good health
nonetheless , there is an increasing anxiety among canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system .
citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it .
the anxiety arises from a number of sources , including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on in recent years .
the federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for canadians and , therefore , it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels .
it will introduce legislation to increase to $ 12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the canada health and social transfer .
one of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21 st century .
canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of canadians for a better health system .
the government is firmly committed to a publicly administered , comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for canadians anywhere in the country .
the government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare .
it has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties .
the government will play that role in a spirit of openness , pragmatism and innovation .
there are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments .
preparing canada for the 21 st century means ensuring the medicare system meets the needs of the future .
it means responding to emerging issues in health care .
working with its partners , the government will undertake the following initiatives :
it will take measures to support canadians in responding to the expanding needs for home care and community care .
it will develop a national plan , timetable and a fiscal framework for providing canadians with better access to medically necessary drugs .
it will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across canada by establishing the health transition fund to help the provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services , home care and pharmacare .
canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care .
our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health .
as a country , we must increase our efforts to promote healthy lives .
the government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health .
emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country ' s population , including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens .
some of the most urgent health problems today are found in aboriginal communities .
the government will work with other partners and aboriginal communities to
develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase in tuberculosis and diabetes in aboriginal communities ; and
enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on the needs of aboriginal people through a new aboriginal health institute .
the government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country .
building safer communities
safe communities are among the hallmarks of our canadian identity .
while the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years , it is still too high .
the government is committed to ensuring that canada remains a place where canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities .
a safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses .
governments around the world are developing community - based crime prevention programs .
increase funding for community - based crime - prevention initiatives to $ 30 million per year ;
develop alternatives to incarceration for low - risk , non - violent offenders , such as sentencing reforms , community diversion programs , and alternative sanctions ; and
integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice system .
creating opportunity for young canadians
today ' s generation of young canadians is the best educated in our history .
young canadians are living in a country well - positioned for opportunities in the new economy .
yet , the level of unemployment among canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem , and first ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall .
to secure our future as a society , our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work , that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education , and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance .
all canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully .
no single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers .
we must all contribute , each in our areas of competency , to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves .
the government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector , through initiatives such as career edge and the corporate council on youth in the economy , and encourages the private sector to do more .
the government is committed to work with other governments , the private sector , communities and individual canadians to help equip young people for the future .
an important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible access to post - secondary education .
canadians are concerned about the increasing cost of higher education , and the resulting debt burden on students .
the government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of february 1997 .
the government will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education through further changes to the canada student loans program , increased assistance for students with dependents , and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low - and moderate - income canadians attend university or college .
the government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high - growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young canadians are unemployed .
the government will work with the provinces , universities and colleges , the high - tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them .
three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work - a good education , a chance at a first job , and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves .
the government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work .
internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started .
in partnership with provincial governments and the private sector , a canada - wide mentorship program will be developed .
to help those young canadians who need a second chance , the government will develop and expand community - based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills .
these will include establishing multi - purpose aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban aboriginal youth .
the government will continue to support efforts of individuals , communities and other governments to improve canadians ' capacity to learn throughout their lives .
investing in knowledge and creativity
the revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries .
canada is well - positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge - based economy of the 21 st century .
we have the talent , we have the resources , we have the technology , and we have the institutions .
by rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well , we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge - based economy .
this is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21 st century .
the government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk - taking in canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge - based industries to canada .
we will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy .
in particular , the government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium - size businesses develop and commercialize new technology .
the government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for canadians in rural communities .
it will adapt its programs to reflect the social and economic realities of rural canada .
further , the government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge - based economy .
governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science , technology , and the creation of knowledge .
the government of canada ' s endowment of the canada foundation for innovation in partnership with the private sector , the provinces and universities , is helping to build a leading - edge national system of innovation .
all levels of government must do more to provide public support for research done in our universities .
support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research .
increasing support for the arts makes it possible for canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad .
our movies , books , magazines , plays , videos , music , and multi - media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present canadian creativity to the world .
therefore , the government of canada will provide increased support to the canada council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad .
we will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to all canadians by the year 2000 , thereby making canada the most connected nation in the world .
this will provide individuals , schools , libraries , small and large businesses , rural and aboriginal communities , public institutions , and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning , interacting , transacting business and developing their social and economic potential .
for example , we will enhance the voluntary sector ' s capacity to engage canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in canadian life .
a connected nation is more than wires , cables and computers .
it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from canada ' s rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure .
it is also a nation whose people are connected to each other .
the government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of canadian life .
the government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among canadians and to increase knowledge of canada and understanding among canadians ; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young canadians .
expanding opportunities in aboriginal communities
thousands of years ago , aboriginal people began building canada ' s first communities .
today , by strengthening our aboriginal communities , we are reinforcing the diversity that makes canada unique in the world .
the government will
develop relationships with aboriginal people based on the principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability ;
support the building of strong aboriginal communities - communities that provide their members with better living standards and opportunities ; and
strengthen the capacity for good government in aboriginal communities .
to contribute , the government of canada is committed to respond to the report of the royal commission on aboriginal peoples as soon as possible .
looking outward
this tradition is the legacy of nobel laureate and former prime minister of canada , lester pearson , whose 100 th birthday we mark this year .
canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it new relevance as the world enters a new century .
nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than canada ' s leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti - personnel mines .
this canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in ottawa in december of this year .
canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim .
canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds 9 % of the earth ' s fresh water , 10 % of its forests , and 25 % of its wetlands .
canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future .
maintaining what is good , and improving what has been degraded , requires constant effort .
it is an effort that the government will make .
the government is committed to working in the international community to promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to global environmental problems , such as greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals .
it will also continue to address the serious international problem of over - fishing .
it is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems .
in this same canadian tradition of internationalism , the government will undertake the following initiatives :
it will promote canadian values on the world stage by co - operating with like - minded countries to revitalize the united nations and other key multilateral institutions .
it will work directly with other countries to enhance and promote human rights , peace building and democracy .
it will destroy the department of national defence ' s stock of land mines , in advance of the signing of the ottawa treaty in december , to continue its leadership and illustrate its commitment to a global ban .
and canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations reclaim their land from these mines .
it will continue to move forward with reforms to the canadian military .
it will continue its campaign for liberalized trade .
breaking down trade barriers , both within canada and around the world , helps ensure markets for canadian goods and services and provides the best opportunity for greater prosperity .
celebrating the millennium
for canadians , the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future .
it will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity , the strength of canadian values , and the great promise of our future in the 21 st century .
the government will help build a partnership among governments , communities and citizens to mark the new millennium .
many canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects .
there will also be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate in developing ideas to mark the millennium .
moving forward into the 21 st century
almost 100 years ago , sir wilfrid laurier said , '' the 20 th century shall be the century of canada and of canadian development . ''
he was right .
today , we have the opportunity for success in the 21 st century that is far beyond what laurier could have ever imagined .
to achieve this success we have more work to do - work that no one can do alone .
each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country .
our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century .
by working together , by respecting the value of our diversity , we will secure our future and build a stronger country .
we will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound , our children well prepared , our lives healthy , and our communities strong .
each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children .
the greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make canada a better place : a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people .
by working together , we will build that future .

speech from the throne
address in reply
the house proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered by his excellency the governor general at the opening of the session .
ms. sarmite bulte -lrb- parkdale - high park , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is a very great privilege and an honor that has been bestowed upon me today to make this motion which is to be seconded by the hon. member for beauce for the address in reply to the speech from the throne .
i would like to thank the prime minister and the government for the honor they have bestowed on the people of parkdale - high park with their motion .
i am also honored and privileged to be the first member of parliament of latvian and baltic states heritage to take a seat in the house of commons , which in latvian is stated as follows :
i would like to thank the people of parkdale - high park who have placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their interests in the house of commons .
as their member i vow to work with my colleagues and in partnership with the private and non - profit sectors to address the challenges which we face today and in the future .
i would also like to especially acknowledge and thank my hon. predecessor mr. jesse flis who represented the riding of parkdale - high park for over 14 years .
i would like to thank him for the legacy he has left in the riding .
mr. flis , we salute , thank and applaud you .
the riding of parkdale - high park , a microcosm of canada , is one of the most culturally and economically diverse ridings in this country .
it is a very united riding , a riding that takes strength from its diversity and its sense of community , a riding which is exemplary of what can be accomplished through community based activities and initiatives , a riding that shows that diversity does not equate to disunity .
i believe that fostering partnerships is a key to addressing the issues and challenges which we will face today and in the future .
in that context i would like to address three issues : job creation , the development of safe and prosperous communities , and the importance of the arts in articulating canada ' s identity .
in its previous mandate this government committed to canadians that it would ensure its strong economic fundamentals would be in place in order to promote economic recovery and job creation .
the prime minister and his government have been successful at meeting and surpassing their targets of deficit reduction .
the government predicts that we shall see the deficit eliminated well prior to the end of this mandate .
i commend my colleagues on their achievements .
our purpose must now be to take advantage of a vigorous economy and create jobs .
in my opinion , the government has a duty to ease job creation by promoting the kind of economic environment we need and by nurturing partnerships with the private and non - profit sectors .
the minister of finance has completed the first task .
the minister of industry and his colleagues are now responding to the second task with their jobs strategy .
one aspect of the jobs strategy is to target youth employment .
as the mother of three children i commend the government for the initiative it has recently undertaken with the announcement of the youth internship program .
this program is a partnership combining the efforts of the federal government , the ymca , and career edge , the non - profit agency developed by 100 canadian corporations to promote youth employment .
one of canada ' s chartered banks has recently undertaken a comprehensive national study of the attitudes of canada ' s nexus generation who are young people between the ages of 18 and 35 .
this study reveals that this group is much more entrepreneurial and positive than usually depicted .
one - third of nexus respondents stated that their most desirable profession was entrepreneur , suggesting that young canadians are determined to turn their innovative ideas into business realities .
further to this , it is my belief that government does not create jobs , the private sector does .
in canada over the last three years 70 per cent to 80 per cent of new jobs were created by small and medium size businesses .
small business needs access to capital , trade and technology .
government can help small business by encouraging banks , including the business development bank of canada , to lend money to these entrepreneurs .
as well , government can support small business by arranging trade missions such as the successful team canada initiatives and the november trade mission to washington for women business owners .
women - owned businesses are a significant sector of our economy .
as a founding member of the women entrepreneurs of canada , i know first hand about the strength of women - owned businesses .
at the recent women leaders ' network for apec economies held in ottawa , it was noted that 700,000 companies in canada are owned by women and that they employ 1.7 million people , which is greater than the canadian business top 100 companies .
they are also creating jobs at a rate four times the national average .
private trade missions should be encouraged .
organizations such as les femmes chefs d ' entreprises mondiales are vehicles through which private citizens can act as goodwill ambassadors and introduce canadian products and services to other countries .
in august i held job creation focus groups with business people , community leaders and residents in parkdale - high park .
i also met with leaders from the arts community and women entrepreneurs of canada .
several critical points emerged from these discussions .
it was emphasized that it was important to support small business and to reduce the amount of official paperwork and red tape that is required for the functioning of a small business .
further , i was told about the real importance of developing strong community structures such as co - operative business development and the need to continue spending dollars on infrastructure which brings new technologies such as fiber optic cable and isdn connections to the community .
although supporting technology is of primary importance , we must acknowledge there is a need for a healthy environment as well as excellent basic facilities such as skating rinks , parks and community centres .
a strong and prosperous community is safe and a safe community will be strong and thriving .
in parkdale - high park just last month the parkdale community watch won the distinguished 1997 international society of crime prevention practitioners community based program of the year award .
this award acknowledges the success and initiative that parkdale residents have taken toward combating crime in their community .
this government recognizes the importance of these initiatives as evidenced by the recent announcement by the minister of justice that $ 150 million will be allocated over the next five years to foster such community based programs .
creating partnerships with communities is essential .
the value of community impact statements must be acknowledged , particularly in the case of alleged victimless crimes such as drugs and prostitution where the impact on the community is significant .
consideration must be given to the imposition of more minimum sentences , allowing communities access to the briefing of federal judges and passing legislation to require the proceeds of crime to be reinvested into those communities affected .
my constituents strongly believe that health and justice must work together in partnership with communities not only to fight crime but to fight the causes of crime .
young offenders are one of the greatest tragedies of crime .
victims of crime are not alone in feeling their loss , society too experiences a loss - that of the potential of a young life .
we must redouble our efforts to rehabilitate young offenders and provide whatever support it takes to discourage repeat offenders .
we must , however , ensure that , in the case of violent young offenders , the needs and demands of the public form part of vigorous measures taken to protect society .
as a lawyer i applaud the minister of justice on her commitment to work with her provincial colleagues to reform the justice system in such a way as to better acknowledge the voice of all victims of crime .
i would now like to address one area about which i am particularly passionate , the arts in canada .
as the former volunteer chair of one of canada ' s foremost arts organizations i believe we must invest in programs , opportunities and partnerships which support our culture .
this is one of our greatest responsibilities .
a country ' s real strength lies in its people .
the arts and the culture of a people are the expressions of its heart and soul .
it is the movies , television , music , painting , dance and theater that enable canadians to laugh , talk and cry together .
through them we can express our identity and our similarities and differences .
i believe in investment , in investing in the development of original canadian artistic product .
without our own product , without our own voices , without a generation that shares our vision to keep our culture alive and meaningful , canada will have no legacy .
without this we will never get that opportunity to see our hopes and dreams reflected .
instead we will have to watch and live vicariously through others .
members will hear me speak in parliament about the arts industry because i believe it is just that , an industry .
when we start looking at it that way some surprising things turn up .
the cultural sector represents a significant part of the canadian economy .
the cultural sector contributes $ 25 billion to canada ' s gross domestic product .
this means 900,000 jobs or 6.9 per cent of total employment .
last year canadians spent over $ 2.9 billion on arts events and products .
for every dollar that the federal government has invested in the arts industry ten dollars of economic activity has been generated , an excellent rate of return .
these numbers do not even acknowledge the spin off effect the culture also brings to our economy .
'' the house of martin guerre '' a critically acclaimed production by canadian composer leslie arden , brings people not only to the canadian stage company but also to the restaurants , bars and hotels nearby .
in canada , the arts play a leading role in enabling canadians to define themselves in relation to one another and to the rest of the world .
if we want a strong national identity , we must ensure that control over our cultural institutions , publishing houses , radio and television networks and film productions rests with us .
the liberal government believes that we should balance spending in this sector with a plan to invest in the future of canadian culture .
artists and arts organizations will play a major role in determining how canadians see themselves in 20 years .
the arts are on the cutting edge of the development of new communications and new technologies which will play a major role in not only the economic prosperity of canada but in the world .
we should remember that the arts industry ' s sustenance and growth and the commensurate benefit to government revenues and canadian society can be assisted by the government of canada without increasing the federal debt .
i applaud the federal government ' s commitment to cultural organizations such as the canadian publishing development corporation and the canada council for the arts , which is celebrating its 40 th anniversary .
the creation of the canada television and cable production fund has supported the creation of excellent canadian programming .
we should acknowledge the unique and important voice that the cbc provides to canadian culture and canadian life .
we must continue to ensure the long term health of canada and at the same time we should make sure we put in place partnerships to ensure that canada ' s arts organizations and artists have a chance to continue to promote and develop the ideas , hopes and aspirations of all canadians .
the time has come to show the world that canada has writers , artists , directors and performers second to none , and that we can develop artistic endeavors here in canada which will be produced all over the world .
canada as an exporter of canadian cultural products and not an importer ?
i say welcome to the new millennium .
as members we have all been entrusted with an important responsibility , that of giving political leadership to canada as we move into challenging times .
while we may not all agree on the policy steps required , we do all commit to serving the best interests of our country .
it is this difference of opinion that divides us into five parties and which will lead to spirited debate in this parliament .
debates are at the heart of parliamentary democracy , where it is appropriate to support opposing views .
our political history has shown that the true superiority of the parliamentary system can be fully appreciated through the diversity of views being represented .
i am proud to confirm my support for the prime minister and the government of canada .
i vow to facilitate a true partnership among all canadians toward making canada an even greater country .
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for beauce , that the following address be presented to his excellency the governor general of canada :
to his excellency the right honourable rom o a . leblanc , a member of the queen ' s privy council for canada , chancellor and principal companion of the order of canada , chancellor and commander of the order of military merit , governor general and commander - in - chief of canada .
may it please your excellency :
we , her majesty ' s most loyal and dutiful subjects , the house of commons of canada , in parliament assembled , beg leave to offer our humble thanks to your excellency for the gracious speech which your excellency has addressed to both houses of parliament .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
mr. claude drouin -lrb- beauce , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i wish to pay tribute to his excellency the governor general , mr. rom o leblanc , and to thank him for giving the throne speech before both houses .
i would also like to congratulate you , mr. speaker , on being re - elected to the chair .
we feel , and you have demonstrated to us , that you have all the qualities required for the important job of directing the work of the house .
i would also like to thank the prime minister , who honored me by asking me to move the address in reply to the speech from the throne .
in addition , i would like to congratulate all my colleagues on being elected to office .
representing one ' s constituents well is no small challenge and i know that each of us , with god ' s help , will carry out our duties conscientiously , with respect for the institutions we serve and , of course , for the citizens of our country , canada .
i represent the wonderful riding of beauce .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the very great honor they have bestowed on me by electing me to represent them in the house of commons .
our economy is made up of businesses working in very diversified sectors .
from agriculture and forestry to manufacturing and the service industries , each sector is well represented in our economy .
and let us not forget our excellent maple syrup , a favorite with everyone .
it is because of these enterprises that it has often been said that the beauce region is the kingdom of smbs .
the beauce region , along with the chaudi re - appalaches region , has one of the lowest unemployment rates in quebec , 6.1 per cent in august of this year .
what sets our region apart from others is that when we have a problem , we look for a solution , not a culprit .
instead of going over old ground when it was elected to office on october 25 , 1993 , the liberal government helped put an end to the crisis .
today , after four years of liberal government , canada ' s economic performance is one of the best among the g - 7 industrial nations , and the future looks even more promising .
that is why canadians can look forward with great hope to the future .
from the time of its first election in october 1993 , the liberal government has made job creation its top priority .
in its employment strategy , the liberal government has put public finances back on a sound footing , starting by addressing the problem of the huge deficits inherited from past governments .
it has reduced the deficit from $ 42 billion to under $ 14 billion .
this good management has made it possible to keep interest and inflation rates at their lowest .
these rates , moreover , help businesses to invest and to create jobs , which encourages purchases of major consumer goods .
once the budget is balanced , half of each billion dollar budgetary surplus will be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt .
the other half will be invested in important social and economic programs , including job creation initiatives .
our government believes in young people .
it invests annually in programs that enable young canadians to acquire the knowledge and experience they need to get their careers off to a good start .
in addition , it recently announced the youth internship program in the federal public sector .
the government ' s priorities are first and foremost employment , improved public finances and canadian unity .
for the past 130 years , canada ' s achievements have earned this country the admiration of the whole world .
in fact , according to the united nations , canada happens to provide the best quality of life of any country in the world .
we have reached this level of excellence largely thanks to the values of equality and diversity which we hold dear .
to preserve and improve our federation is to preserve and improve the way we live .
the liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigor of canadian federalism .
this same government has put forward new strategies for getting rid of duplication among levels of government , while showing greater respect for the jurisdictions set forth in the constitution .
the manpower agreement , for instance , is an example of our government ' s desire for a modern federalism .
with the provinces , we have also reached an agreement on environmental harmonization .
we have withdrawn from programs of direct involvement in mining and forestry development and have suggested transferring management of social housing to the provinces .
finally , we suggested introducing federal - provincial mechanisms to deal with securities , food inspection and revenue collection .
the principle of a new federalism will continue to guide our actions during the government ' s present mandate .
every year , more than 300,000 canadians learn french , in a country that should be proud of its two languages and two cultures .
i am proud to be part of this beautiful country we call canada .
it is an honor and a privilege for me , as the new elected member for beauce , to second the motion on the address in reply to the speech from the throne moved by the hon. member for parkdale - high park .
mr. preston manning -lrb- leader of the opposition , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i would like to congratulate you on your re - election and will do so more formally and thoroughly tomorrow .
i would also like to congratulate the members for parkdale - high park and for beauce on their excellent speeches .

i now would like to move :

statements by members
monitor jet trainer aircraft
mr. bob wood -lrb- nipissing , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i rise today to invite all members of parliament to join me this evening at the national aviation museum for the unveiling of the monitor jet trainer aircraft .
i am very proud of this success story which will see a surplus defense department hangar utilized to build the first canadian made military jet in over two decades .
the hard work of the air base property corporation using industry canada and national defence adjustment funds has paid off .
their partnership with canadian aerospace and sikorsky will develop a new aerospace industry in north bay .
i ask all members of the house to join me this evening at the rockcliffe airport from 6 to 8 to view the future of military aviation manufacturing in canada .
experts from the canadian aerospace group and sikorsky will be on hand to explain this unique project .
i look forward to seeing all members there this evening .

chinese canadians
mr. inky mark -lrb- dauphin - swan river , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i am honored to speak in the house for the first time .
more than 700,000 people of chinese ancestry live in canada today , but that was not always so .
in 1902 a royal commission decided that asians were '' unfit for full citizenship - obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state '' .
in 1923 mackenzie king ' s liberal government passed the exclusion act which suspended chinese immigration .
canadian chinese call july 1 , 1923 , the day the exclusion act came into effect , humiliation day .
in 1947 the exclusion act was repealed and canadians of chinese ancestry won their right to be reunited with their families .
i would not be standing here today if that act had not been repealed .
1997 marks the 50 th anniversary of the repeal .
justice will be served only if canada has learned a lesson from this bleak moment in history .
\* \* \*
whitby warriors
ms. judi longfield -lrb- whitby - ajax , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i rise today to recognize the outstanding achievement of the whitby warriors junior a lacrosse club .
this past august the whitby warriors won the minto cup as the best junior a lacrosse team in canada .
in spite of losing the first two games to the burnaby lakers they persevered and came back to win their next four games to take the best seven championship round in six games .
the warriors were led by their top scorers paul sallie , pat jones and gavin prout and backed up by the most valuable player awarded winning performance of goal tender mike wye .
the whitby warriors are coached by jim bishop whose involvement in the sport of lacrosse spans some 51 years .
whitby ' s win was mr. bishop ' s eighth minto cup , coming 28 years after coaching the legendary oshawa green gaels to seven consecutive minto cup championships .
the determination and sportsmanship of the whitby warriors are an inspiration to us all .
i know all members will join with me in honoring the whitby warriors as the junior a champions in canada ' s national summer sport .

national defence
mrs. pierrette venne -lrb- saint - bruno - saint - hubert , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , in 1989 , the department of national defence was ordered by the canadian human rights commission to enrol more women in the next ten years .
at the time , only 9.9 per cent of the members of our armed forces were women .
today , eight years later , their numbers have remained virtually the same , with women accounting for a mere 10.7 per cent of the canadian armed forces .
we note today that the department of national defence has not done a thing to recruit women .
but now they would have us believe they are complying with the human rights tribunal order by launching a recruiting campaign aimed exclusively at women and known as '' operation minerva '' .
dnd knows very well it is impossible to integrate women fully by 1999 . all i have to say to that is : too little too late .
\* \* \*
mr. stan keyes -lrb- hamilton west , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i rise , on this first full sitting day of the 36 th parliament , to reiterate my call to the ontario government for an independent public inquiry into the july plastimet fire in hamilton .
conservative premier mike harris and his environment and health ministers have backtracked , flip - flopped on their pledges for an inquiry , citing the pathetic excuse of the need for evidence of wrongdoing .
is it right that the local mpp had to awaken the provincial environment minister at 3 a.m. before the premier would dispatch air monitoring equipment to the toxic fire site ?
why did the province first refuse and then later accept federal government assistance ?
there are questions of compliance with the ontario fire code , inventory lists , security , and locating a recycling plant near a hospital , schools and a high density residential area .
frustrated with the harris government smokescreen , my constituents demand an independent public inquiry to clear the smoke and to produce recommendations which might prevent an environmental tragedy like the plastimet fire from ever happening again .
\* \* \*
war criminals
ms. elinor caplan -lrb- thornhill , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i rise today in the house on a very important matter to my constituents of thornhill , and i believe all canadians , and that is the prosecution of war criminals .
the people of thornhill , especially the jewish community , believe that canada must be vigilant in prosecuting war criminals .
canada has a moral obligation to deport those who have been found guilty of committing crimes against humanity .
we must not be seen as a haven for nazi war criminals and others who have committed war crimes .
my constituents are aware of the commitment by the liberal government to move on denaturalization and on deportation of those convicted of war crimes .
finally canada is taking action .
canada is doing more now to track nazi war criminals than almost any country in the world .
since 1995 many deportation cases have been initiated and i am confident we will continue to pursue war criminals to the fullest extent of the law .
while this issue is of special importance to the jewish -

mother teresa
mr. reed elley -lrb- nanaimo - cowichan , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i rise today so that the house and its members might pay tribute to the life and memory of mother teresa .
it was with great sadness that canadians learned of her recent death .
this godly and gracious woman was a beacon of hope to the sick and the poor living in the streets of calcutta and whose suffering she tried to ease and deeply felt .
her message to humanity was simple : yes , there is someone who cares .
it is a message that in our world will continue to resonate loudly and will no doubt serve as her lasting legacy .
with the passing of mother teresa the world will indeed be a colder place because the beacon of goodness , though not extinguished , burns a little less brightly today .
i am sure all canadians join me in being thankful for her life .
i ask for all members to observe a time of silence in their own thoughts and pay tribute to the remarkable legacy of caring and giving that was mother teresa .
\* \* \*
immigration
mr. gary pillitteri -lrb- niagara falls , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , this year the international whirlpool bridge that links canada and the u.s. celebrated its 100 th anniversary .
this important celebration reinforced the co - operation existing between our two great countries .
it is therefore difficult to believe that a new american immigration law will soon require that all canadian travellers entering and exiting the united states complete a visa information card .
the community i represent is very concerned that this will cause endless hours of traffic jams and may damage the tourist and trade links we have established over a period of many years of co - operation .
it is then my sincere hope the proposed amendments exempting canadians traveling to the u.s. each year are passed as soon as possible .
in the meantime i ask our government to keep pressure on our friends south of the border to implement the amendments so that this controversial law will not cause havoc in border communities across canada .
\* \* \*
algeria
mr. daniel turp -lrb- beauharnois - salaberry , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , five months after condemning in this house the civil war in algeria , the canadian government has yet to call upon the international community to find a peaceful solution .
this silence has made it possible for the tragic events that took place in benthala , algeria , over monday night , to occur .
the majority of the 200 people killed in this massacre were women and children .
in view of the increase in acts of terrorism and senseless violence in algeria that have left more than 60,000 victims in recent years , according to amnesty international estimates , quebec , canada and the international community must echo the voices of the bereaved families by utterly condemning the use of violence and seeking a political solution to the algerian crisis .

speech from the throne
ms. marlene jennings -lrb- notre - dame - de - gr cents ce - lachine , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , as a black canadian from quebec , of aboriginal and french descent , i am very proud to represent the riding of notre - dame - de - gr cents ce - lachine in the 36 th parliament of canada .
the speech from the throne delivered yesterday is , in my opinion , a speech on national unity .
i wish to advise the house , and in particular the hon. st phane dion , minister of intergovernmental affairs -
the speaker :
my dear colleague , you must not refer to hon. members by name , but by riding .
you have a few more seconds .
ms. marlene jennings :
i wish to advise the house that my constituents are delighted with the initiatives of the government with respect to the canadian unity file .
i want to assure the house that i intend to continue to contribute and encourage my constituents to actively support these very welcome and timely initiatives .
\* \* \*
canadian economy
mr. guy st - julien -lrb- abitibi , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , there can be no doubt that the canadian economy is back on track .
the cost of living is going up very slowly , while retail trade is stronger than it has been in years .
statistics canada announced that , between july and august , the consumer price index increased by 0.19 per cent , the same level as for the two previous months .
between august 1996 and august 1997 , canadian consumers have faced an average increase of 1.8 per cent in the cost of living , which is pretty low .
all this is good news for canadians .
\* \* \*
pay equity
ms. angela vautor -lrb- beaus jour - petitcodiac , ndp -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the federal government has decided to give public service executives bonuses totalling some $ 12.2 million , when close to $ 2 billion is owed to the 80,000 members of the public service alliance of canada , and when many canadian families continue to live in poverty and unemployment .
the government is not in compliance with its own pay equity legislation .
while public service executives are getting significant bonuses , many clerks , secretaries and other employees are still not being paid the retroactive payments owed to them .
i hope the treasury board will pay what is owed to these employees and thus fulfill its commitment to female members of the public service and to women in general .
in order to correct this injustice , we are also asking that a new budget be tabled as early as this fall .
\* \* \*
princess diana
mr. keith martin -lrb- esquimalt - juan de fuca , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , death stalks all of us and can be cruel , but never more so than when it takes the life of the young .
on august 31 the world lost a beautiful soul in the death of princess diana .
and we all grieved .
we grieved not only for the loss of someone filled with so much promise , but also for someone in whom we saw ourselves .
she set an example in how to overcome our difficulties .
she taught us to reach inside ourselves to become something greater than what we are by helping those who are less fortunate .
diana championed the plight of sick children , aids patients , the terminally ill .
recently she brought to the front of the world stage the horrors of landmines and their tragic victims .
as canadians , we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to the family of the princess and especially to her sons , princes william and harry .
\* \* \*
universit du qu bec chicoutimi
mr. denis coderre -lrb- bourassa , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , last friday i had the pleasure of announcing on behalf of the government of canada the investment of $ 750,000 over five years , via the national sciences and engineering research council , in a new industrial engineering chair at the universit du qu bec chicoutimi .
the professor currently holding that chair , masoud farzaneh , will study the impact of freezing rain on power transmission network equipment .
two industrial partners , hydro - quebec and alcan , have also contributed to the funding of this chair .
creation of this chair is evidence of the liberal government ' s desire to work in conjunction with our partners in industry , the universities and provincial agencies to develop new knowledge which will improve electrical service and eliminate power outages caused by precipitation freezing on transmission lines .
this is further evidence that canada is working to ensure the success of all quebecers .
\* \* \*
canada pension plan
mrs. elsie wayne -lrb- saint john , pc -rrb- :
mr. speaker , yesterday ' s throne speech gives canadians every reason to be worried about their future retirement plans .
older canadians have earned the right to a secure retirement .
middle class workers cannot afford to pay more for the same benefits .
younger canadians want the cpp to be there when they need it .
the liberals plan to fix the cpp will be a further $ 11 billion tax hike on working canadians and employers if the government refuses to reduce the ei premiums .
this government has a hidden agenda with the proposed seniors ' benefit .
it hurts middle income canadians the most .
it disproportionately attacks women by basing it on family income and it discourages people to save for their retirement .
i ask the government to stop punishing canadians who have worked and saved for their retirement and urge them to put the seniors benefit on hold until there are full consultations on the proposed plan .
\* \* \*
mother teresa
ms. albina guarnieri -lrb- mississauga east , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , earlier this month the world lost the moral beacon of the 20 th century .
nobel peace prize winner mother teresa led a life that challenged the modern world by teaching us that lifestyle is not more important than life .
she accumulated no material possessions , shunned political power and never succumbed to moral compromises .
her life was consumed by the simple goal of providing food , education , medical care , love and hope to the sick and desolate .
her notion of charity was not to hold black tie fundraisers and send others to do the messy work .
no , mother teresa ' s example was to pick the maggots out of people ' s open wounds herself .
no human has done so much , for so many , for so little .
but her life ' s work , not even respect for the dead , could spare her from those who want to protect their world from her message .
fully half of the media ' s coverage of mother teresa ' s death was devoted to criticism of her life and beliefs .
there are obviously many maggot infested wounds that still need to be cleansed by the millions she inspired .
she will be remembered simply and affectionately as mother .
the speaker :
before starting question period i want to share with you some of the intentions developed with the house leaders in consultation with me .
i know that this is the first day and i will give us all a bit of leeway .
however , i would like to ask you to consider joining with me in the days and weeks ahead in the following manner .
it would be my intention to shorten the length of time for both the questions and the answers from what we had in the last parliament so that , on average , we can have more questions .
this will mean that the advance statements by the questioners will be shorter .
i would also ask for the help of the ministers to keep their responses shorter .
so now we shall see how things go today .
we will keep track of the time .
oral question period
government expenditures
mr. preston manning -lrb- leader of the opposition , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is a pleasure to be back in the house , and i am not just talking about stornoway .
in his election platform the prime minister promised canadians a 50:50 split between increased spending on one hand and debt and tax reduction on the other .
yet in yesterday ' s speech from the throne his government listed at least 29 new spending measures , but not one single practical measure for either debt reduction or tax relief .
was this simply an oversight ?
did he just leave something out of the speech or does this signal a return to liberal chequebook spending ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i welcome the new leader of the opposition in this house .
we have made a commitment that very soon the country will be in a position to operate with a surplus .
the budget is scheduled for the month of february .
we have the time but first we have to go to a zero deficit .
we had to reduce the disastrous deficit of $ 42 billion left by the conservative party .
every year we are obliged to spend some money on some programs because of the problems in society which need to be taken care of .
it is always the liberal approach to care and be responsible to others .
mr. preston manning -lrb- leader of the opposition , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , my colleagues and i find it inconceivable that the department of finance would truly endorse a return to spending as the number one fiscal priority of the government .
economists inside and outside the department have been saying for years that the federal government cannot spend its way to lower unemployment and that irresponsible spending and taxation is what is keeping unemployment high .
has the prime minister simply forgotten about the seriousness of the debt or the high tax levels , or is he telling the house that higher spending is the number one fiscal priority of his government ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. preston manning -lrb- leader of the opposition , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , there are 29 proposals in the throne speech for higher spending and nothing on debt reduction or tax reduction .
if the government makes higher spending its number one priority , there will be no surpluses .
therefore 50 per cent of zero is zero , and there is zero for tax relief or debt reduction .
is not this 50:50 formula simply a shell game , like the gst promise in the previous election , to allow the government to do what it really wants to do , which is to return to excessive spending ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , obviously the leader of the opposition does not have anything very concrete on which to attack the government .
he is setting a target to shoot at .
we said very clearly we will spend more money when we are in a surplus position .
at the same time there are problems in society that have to be fixed and we will do it in a responsible way .
around the world today people look to canada because we are an example of a fiscally responsible government and , at the same time , a government caring for those who need the most help in our society .
\* \* \*
employment
mr. monte solberg -lrb- medicine hat , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , in february the minister of finance said a 5 per cent jobless rate was not only achievable but desirable .
however , according to his department this is hogwash .
it is forecasting 9 per cent , 8 per cent next year and 7 per cent until the year 2015 .
can the minister explain why he is publicly talking about a 5 per cent unemployment rate when privately his department says the opposite ?
who is right and who is wrong ?
hon. paul martin -lrb- minister of finance , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the hon. member is wrong .
the debate to which the hon. member refers is a discussion over the natural rate of unemployment , the rate at which inflation would take off , and there is , in fact , a difference of opinion .
this government clearly states that an arbitrary number , like 8 per cent for a nairu , is not applicable to a country whose productivity is improving , a country where interest rates are low , a country whose industry has become lean and competitive .
all i can tell the hon. member is that alan greenspan agrees with me and i will take him over the member for medicine hat .
mr. monte solberg -lrb- medicine hat , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , in canada several economists say that the long term natural rate for unemployment is well over the 5 per cent that the minister is talking about .
under this government my 13 year old son will be middle aged before we get within shouting distance of that 5 per cent target .
when is the minister going to take the advice of the real job creators and cut taxes ?
canadians want tax cuts .
i would like an answer from the prime minister - in - waiting , please .
hon. paul martin -lrb- minister of finance , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it does the member good to be in the official opposition .
for the first time he understands the real political truths in this country .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. paul martin :
no , not about me , but that they will never make it .
let me give a couple of numbers .
in the last four years under this prime minister the canadian public has created over 970,000 new jobs .
this year under this prime minister the canadian public has created over 260,000 new jobs , the vast majority of those in the private sector .
under this prime minister the youth unemployment rate has started to go down .
under this prime minister the -
some hon. members :
more , more .
mr. gilles duceppe -lrb- laurier - sainte - marie , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , yesterday the governor general read a speech from the throne that contained a number of particularly moving , even lyrical , passages on canada in the 21 st century .
the reality of the matter , however , is quite something else .
will the prime minister not acknowledge that the speech from the throne sanctions his vision of canada , where all major decisions will be made in ottawa , with the provinces being relegated to the position of subsidiaries of ottawa , and where quebecers as a people have no place ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , we made frequent reference in the speech from the throne to the partnership we want with the provinces .
we made frequent reference in the speech from the throne to what we intend to do for the children of poor families in canada .
i would like to make it clear to the former leader of the opposition that , at the first ministers ' meeting in june last year , all the provincial governments and premiers in attendance , including the premier of quebec , agreed to our establishing a child credit program to help poor families .
this shows that we can work together within canada as partners .
mr. gilles duceppe -lrb- laurier - sainte - marie , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the prime minister uses the term '' partners '' because he thinks it is a popular term and would give it the same meaning it was given by the sovereignists .
however , we have no illusions about this , because when the prime minister talks about partnership , it is the kind of partnership in which the political decisions are made in ottawa and the provinces are asked to carry them out .
the provinces are being treated like so many municipalities .
would the prime minister agree that the throne speech has demonstrated , more clearly than ever before , that there are two diametrically opposed visions of canada : one in quebec where , since jean lesage , people have wanted to be '' ma tres chez nous '' and one in the rest of canada , the one in the calgary declaration where quebecers are just as unique as pacific salmon ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the leader of the third party overlooks the fact that we have worked very hard with the provinces since we came to power .
take , for instance , quebec ' s traditional demands regarding manpower training .
we have entered into an agreement with the provincial governments , including the government of quebec .
for many years , the government of quebec and the other governments complained that we were involved in areas they would rather see us out of .
that is why we withdrew from forestry , mining , tourism , social housing and manpower training .
mr. michel gauthier -lrb- roberval , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , yesterday in the speech from the throne , the prime minister wanted , he said , to launch an appeal to citizens to work together to save canada , except that nothing about the speech is likely to please quebec .
my question is for the prime minister .
will he confirm that his party has buried the concept of distinct society once and for all and replaced it with the concept of '' unique character '' ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i want to point out to the member for roberval that he voted against distinct society here in this house .
i also want to point out to the member for roberval that , when he was an mna , he voted against the meech lake accord in the national assembly .
and i am very pleased with the premiers ' attitude in this regard .
mr. michel gauthier -lrb- roberval , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , in exchanging niceties with the prime minister , might i remind him that he was the one who was traipsing all over quebec during the last election campaign promising quebecers that he would sell the rest of canada on the idea of a distinct society , not i.
is the prime minister now telling us that once again he is going to change his story and not fulfil the commitment he made to the voters of quebec ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , we have always stressed the necessity of recognizing the distinct character of quebec because of its language , its culture , and its civil code .
the formula the premiers saw fit to accept a few weeks ago is a new one which describes the quebec reality , something we continue to fight for , while the bloc quebecois , in the house of commons , and the parti quebecois , in the national assembly , have voted against anything which could accommodate quebec so as to enable it to prosper within canada .

employment
ms. alexa mcdonough -lrb- halifax , ndp -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i have waited a long time for this moment .
my question is to the prime minister .
on behalf of 1.4 million unemployed canadians , will the government commit today to set clear timetables and targets for the reduction of unemployment ?
the government has done it with respect to deficit reduction .
when will the government do the same for unemployment and show that it is serious about putting canadians back to work ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , first i would like to welcome the hon. leader of the new democratic party to the house of commons .
i am happy to have her here .
i know she has waited a long time and i hope she will stay for a long time too .
i would like to say that we want to reduce unemployment and we are working very hard on it .
the first thing we had to do was to put the finances of the nation in order .
a few years ago we had a deficit of $ 42 billion and very soon we will have reduced it to zero .
we have to do that in order to create jobs .
when there is no inflation , low interest rates and a competitive dollar , we can produce and be very competitive .
it is in that way that we will create the jobs .
ms. alexa mcdonough -lrb- halifax , ndp -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is obvious that 155 liberal cheerleaders over there are pretty pleased with their record .
since the last liberal throne speech promised to tackle youth unemployment , 26,000 more young people in this country have not been able to find jobs and they are not cheering .
if not , will it admit that it has simply given up doing anything to help the young people who most desperately need its help ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i have tried to explain in a few words that we must have the basic elements to create jobs in the country .
it is not by spending money that we will cure the problems of the nation .
we have to do it in a responsible way and we have to put the books of the nation in order .
i would like to quote some advice i read on february 10 of this year .
it was said that we have come too far and have worked too hard to restart the cycle of careless spending .
therefore , we will not follow the advice of the leader of the new democratic party .
we will follow the advice of mr. roy romanow who spoke in front of the saskatchewan chamber of commerce .
hon. jean j . charest -lrb- sherbrooke , pc -rrb- :
his government said in the speech from the throne that it cares about unemployment in general and about youth unemployment in particular .
the government could take concrete action immediately by reducing employment insurance premiums .
this is what the canadian chamber of commerce and the canadian federation of independent business , as well as quebec ' s chamber of commerce and conseil du patronat , are asking for .
what is this government waiting for to end this abuse and put people back to work ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , first of all , i wish to welcome the conservative party leader , who is now back in the front row .
we are happy to see him and look forward to be closer to him and to see him more often than in the last parliament .
the conservative party leader should know that , when we came to office , the unemployment insurance fund showed an enormous deficit , because the conservative government had not exercised prudence .
the conservatives had to increase premiums from $ 2 to $ 3.30 , at a time when unemployment was on the rise in canada .
hon. jean j . charest -lrb- sherbrooke , pc -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i want to thank the prime minister for his kind words in welcoming me back to the house .
i would caution him against wishing that i be here too often and remind him of the old chinese proverb that he may end up getting what he wishes for .
today i want to offer the prime minister a great opportunity , an opportunity to do something for unemployed canadians and young unemployed canadians .
if he acts today he can put thousands of people back to work in the next few weeks by reducing employment insurance premiums , this tax , this rip - off on canadians to the tune of billions of dollars .
to be clear , i want to ask the prime minister one simple , straightforward question .
does he and his government believe that this employment insurance system should be used for the purpose of reducing the deficit , yes or no ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , we did not want to run the affairs of the nation the way that the previous government did .
it never had any surplus in the unemployment insurance fund .
we want to act as prudent managers in order to make sure that our financial situation is good in canada and that we have low interest rates .
we have that now and that is what is creating the 4 per cent growth that we will have this year in canada .
we are the leaders of the g - 7 countries in this .

throne speech
miss deborah grey -lrb- edmonton north , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the equality of citizens and provinces became a huge factor and played a large part in the calgary premiers conference last week .
in fact their framework for discussion listed the word equality five times .
yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word equality even once ; uniqueness , diversity , all kinds of words , but not equality .
my question for the prime minister is in yesterday ' s throne speech why in the world was the equality of citizens and provinces deliberately left out ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , when we said we want to work in partnership and in collaboration with the provinces it is because we believe in equality .
that is exactly the purpose of it .
about the equality of individuals , i do not have any lessons to receive from the hon. member for edmonton north because i was the minister of justice who gave the charter of rights to all citizens of canada to make them equal .
miss deborah grey -lrb- edmonton north , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the concept of equality and the word equality is what is important .
speaking of justice ministers , it is a wonder that this justice minister did not notice the absence of the word equality and insist that it be put in the throne speech .
it is very strange that the government would mention the unique character of quebec society and the diversity inherent in the federation and yet not mention equality .
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is something i have talked about and lived by for the last 34 years that i have been a member of parliament .
this is very important .
equality means that we recognize the people for what they are .
in a family equality means that sometimes we have to have solutions that are meeting the needs in one part of canada but which are not needed elsewhere .
we have , for example , despite equality a terrible problem of poverty in canada .
this means that those who are rich have to help those who are poor .
the speaker :
the hon. member for t miscamingue .
mr. pierre brien -lrb- t miscamingue , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the prime minister .
in the throne speech we heard that the federal government , as its financial position improves , intends to intervene increasingly in areas of provincial jurisdiction , including health and education .
how can the prime minister justify increasing involvement by its government in health and education , considering that these areas have always been the responsibility of provincial governments ?
hon. st phane dion -lrb- president of the queen ' s privy council for canada and minister of intergovernmental affairs , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , canada happens to be one of the most decentralized federations in the world , and together we have built a federation that has provided us with the best quality of life of any country .
and we managed to do this because both levels of government , federal and provincial , are learning to work together and to concentrate on the areas for which they are responsible .
in the health sector , the federal government ' s responsibilities are those that are recognized in the constitution .
there is nothing unconstitutional about having five moral principles that are accepted throughout canada , including quebec , and as a result can be applied anywhere in canada , both in the wealthiest and the less wealthy provinces .
i may remind the hon. member that the province that benefits the most per capita from the canada social transfer happens to be quebec .
mr. pierre brien -lrb- t miscamingue , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , this is the first time a federal government has so clearly indicated its intention of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction , especially education .
would the prime minister or his minister agree that his program to measure the readiness of children to learn is , in fact , a foot in the door of the education sector , with all the consequences that involves : federal programs , federal assessment criteria , federal employees , and on top of that , taxpayers who will again pay twice as a result of this latest duplication ?
hon. pierre s . pettigrew -lrb- minister of human resources development , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i am always amazed by the excessive reactions we get from that side of the house .
however , if they get their kicks by measuring the orthodoxy of every word , by all means , let them make a study of semantics .
what we promised in the throne speech yesterday was to let canadians benefit from a study by statistics canada , for which my department is responsible .
i am referring to a national longitudinal survey we have been doing for several years .
since we invest enormous amounts of money in the well - being of our children , we feel it is very important to measure their progress , so that when they go to school , they are in the best possible position to learn .

national unity
mr. rahim jaffer -lrb- edmonton - strathcona , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , except for premier bouchard , who did not attend the calgary conference , all of canada ' s provincial premiers agreed to put the question on national unity to the canadian people .
does the prime minister think it is acceptable for quebecers to be the only canadians who will not be consulted on national unity ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i want to thank the hon. member for his question .
right now , the provincial governments have made a joint decision to consult the people before adopting resolutions in their respective legislatures .
in the case of quebec , the present government of quebec is not interested in consulting quebecers on their genuine participation within canada .
right now , the provinces have decided to consult their citizens before adopting their resolution .
as soon as quebec wants to adopt its resolution , i would ask the government of quebec to do likewise .
as far as we are concerned , if these resolutions are passed or adopted by all the provinces , i said before that the house of commons has voted on distinct society , and we are prepared to vote on the words chosen by the premiers after a debate in this house .
but we will have to wait and see what happens in the provinces , which are working on this right now .
mr. rahim jaffer -lrb- edmonton - strathcona , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , mr. bouchard has said that he will not take part in any public consultation process .
meech lake and charlottetown failed because canadians were not consulted .
knowing this , will the prime minister clarify how the calgary declaration will be communicated to the people of quebec and by whom ?
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , with due respect to the hon. member , on charlottetown people were consulted .
there was a referendum .
among the reforms that we favored was the election of the senate .
the reform party voted against it .
at this moment the provinces are doing their work .
in due course we will act .
i have talked with the premiers and they are doing , in a very different way , the way they want , their own consultations before they vote on the issue .
we do not want to duplicate that in the other provinces .
at this moment there is no debate going on before the national assembly on the question of the calgary declaration .
when there is a debate i hope they will consult with the people .
if need be we might consult with them , but at this moment the timing is not appropriate .

speech from the throne
mr. yvan loubier -lrb- saint - hyacinthe - bagot , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , in the throne speech , the government claims to be sensitive to the problems of low income families with children and the problems in the education and health case systems .
my question is for the minister of finance .
does the minister of finance admit that the problems the government has identified in these areas are basically due to the cuts of over $ 40 billion it made during its first mandate and intends to keep on making during this mandate ?
hon. paul martin -lrb- minister of finance , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , because of the efforts made by this government , and indeed all canadians , in terms of putting our fiscal house in order , the government can now afford to provide assistance to society ' s most disadvantaged , namely poor children .
in fact , our intentions were not expressed only in the throne speech .
judging from recent budgets and the actions taken by my colleague , the minister of human resources development , and by other colleagues regarding the child tax credit , internship programs and all this government has put in place for the poor in this country , it is very clear that what our government intends to do is to help canadians , not to divide them .
mr. yvan loubier -lrb- saint - hyacinthe - bagot , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the axeman seldom woos his victims , but that is what the minister of finance is doing , since he is responsible for poverty in canada .
by the way , will the minister admit that his solution to health , education and poverty problems is to cut $ 42 billion instead of $ 48 billion as initially planned ?
in other words , all he has to offer as a solution is to cut $ 6 billion less than he had planned .
hon. paul martin -lrb- minister of finance , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i suggest that the hon. member across the way , where he was before the election , compare the first campeau budget tabled when the parti quebecois took office in quebec with the forecast now being made by mr. landry .
he will see that , thanks to federal activities and initiatives , the amount available to mr. landry to help the disadvantaged is $ 1.5 billion higher than originally planned by mr. campeau .
i do hope the pq government will use this money to help the most disadvantaged in quebec .

health care
mr. grant hill -lrb- macleod , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , when the health minister was recently asked where he would find the money for national pharmacare , he replied : '' i don ' t know but it ' s a really good idea '' .
when patients are trapped in the longest waiting lines in history why would anybody be thinking about a brand new national program ?
hon. allan rock -lrb- minister of health , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the first and fundamental challenge we face with our health care system , and i know the hon. member is aware of this , is restoring the confidence of canadians in the basic medicare which we have come to know and depend on .
the government is firmly committed to not only the five principles of the canada health act but to working with our partners in the provinces , with providers and with other stakeholders in the system to restore the health system to the quality canadians expect and deserve .
that is going to mean a lot of work .
it is going to mean working with provinces and others to tackle issues such as waiting lists .
it is going to mean dealing with -
the speaker :
the hon. member for macleod .
mr. grant hill -lrb- macleod , ref . -rrb- :
i call that clueless .
medicare has suffered and lies wounded .
why would anybody carry on with a brand new program like this when medicare itself needs to be fixed ?
hon. allan rock -lrb- minister of health , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i know the hon. member is a better doctor than he is a mathematician .
he knows full well that the cuts by this government were nowhere near 40 per cent .
what i said to my provincial partners is that we are going to work toward pharmacare as a long term goal because this government believes that in the long term the partners should work with us in creating a system where every citizen of this country should have access to the drugs they need and should not be kept from them because of price .

employment insurance
mr. paul cr te -lrb- kamouraska - rivi re - du - loup - t miscouata - les basques , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of human resources development .
the liberal government has cut unemployment insurance by billions of dollars , turning a deaf ear to the cries of alarm coming from the unemployed and from seasonal workers .
how can the minister justify a throne speech that contains nothing at all for the unemployed and for seasonal workers , when he knows that the unemployment insurance fund will again this year produce a surplus of at least $ 7 billion ?
hon. pierre s . pettigrew -lrb- minister of human resources development , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the hon. member will have to take another look at the throne speech , because there are several references to what we are going to do and have been doing for some time now .
in particular , we announced a youth employment strategy , which is extremely important .
we are working very hard on the unemployment issue and you know it .
this strategy , which creates work experience , is doing well .
we have identified tools that worked well and we will consolidate and extend them so that the work experience young people need to make the transition from school to the work place is a very positive one .
there is also the transitional job creation fund , $ 95 million of which has been invested in job creation in quebec .
mr. paul cr te -lrb- kamouraska - rivi re - du - loup - t miscouata - les basques , bq -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is very clear from the minister ' s reply that he is not in the least concerned about the plight of seasonal and other workers entering the job market .
my question is not what he is doing to help them re - enter the job market , but what he is doing to help them survive and not all end up on welfare .
hon. pierre s . pettigrew -lrb- minister of human resources development , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , we are very concerned about the situation the member describes and i would appreciate it if he listened to the reply , because it is important that he tell his constituents and all those living in his riding what to do .
we have set up a transitional job creation fund .
we do not believe in passive income support .
that is what our workers want .
\* \* \*
immigration
mr. carmen provenzano -lrb- sault ste . marie , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , my question is for the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs .
a new american law requiring canadians crossing into the united states to undergo a lengthy and invasive inspection process could have disastrous effects on sault ste . marie tourism and the normal flow of business between our city and its american neighbors .
what steps is the federal government taking to ensure canadians will continue to have easy access to the united states ?
mr. ted mcwhinney -lrb- parliamentary secretary to minister of foreign affairs , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the new measures announced by the united states are extremely damaging to canadian and to american business .
they are counter to the initiatives taken by the president of the united states and the prime minister to dismantle controls at borders and to promote the free circulation of people and of goods .
they are probably counter to nafta .
our objective is to secure the removal of those controls from application at the canada - u.s. border .
we are encouraged already in our efforts by the amendments introduced by a member of the united states senate and a member of the united states congress to this effect .
\* \* \*
fisheries
mr. john duncan -lrb- vancouver island north , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the government has made a mess of the pacific salmon dispute .
we have seen four years of mismanagement on this file .
hon. david anderson -lrb- minister of fisheries and oceans , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the hon. member ' s assertion is incorrect .
the issue , however , of the salmon treaty is an important one .
i am disappointed the fisheries critic of the official opposition would choose for his first question such a trivial , irrelevant and inaccurate comment as the one he has made .
mr. john duncan -lrb- vancouver island north , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the throne speech contains not one word about resolving the pacific salmon dispute .
the government continues to show a lack of commitment to british columbia .
will the minister make resolving the treaty by january 31 the number one priority of his department ?
hon. david anderson -lrb- minister of fisheries and oceans , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , we are again hearing questioning by reform members who obviously have not read the throne speech or listened to it .
the fact is that in the throne speech there is a clear commitment to continue to deal with the issue of foreign overfishing .
if the fisheries critic of the official opposition knew something about the problem of the pacific salmon treaty , he would know that it began because the alaskans overfished canadian bound sockeye salmon in northern british columbia going to the nass and skeena rivers , to the tune of three times what they had done previously under the treaty .
that is what he has not understood and he has not understood that the throne speech addresses it directly .

petitions
health and drug act
mr. jim gouk -lrb- west kootenay - okanagan , ref . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , i have the honor to present three petitions on the same subject that vary a bit .
each of them calls on the government to reject proposed changes to the canada health and drug act that would prevent people from taking dietary supplements or herbal goods of their own choice .
national highways
mr. john finlay -lrb- oxford , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , my congratulations on your re - election , sir .
i have two petitions to present today .
the first petition is signed by 30 of my constituents and calls upon parliament to urge the federal government to join with the provincial governments in making the national highway system upgrading possible beginning in 1997 .
criminal code
mr. john finlay -lrb- oxford , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , the second petition is signed by 57 of my constituents .
it calls upon parliament to enact legislation to amend the criminal code , specifically sections 173 and 174 , the indecent act and public nudity provisions , to clearly state that a woman exposing her breasts in a public place is an indecent act .
co - operatives
mr. alex shepherd -lrb- durham , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , it is my pleasure today to present a petition on behalf of 57 constituents who live in a co - op housing project on 610 beatrice street in my riding .
in part they indicate that the government of canada and the canada mortgage and housing corporation have begun secret negotiations with the province of ontario , that the people who own and operate co - operatives have been excluded from these negotiations , and that the government of ontario has already breached its own agreements with provincially funded housing co - operatives .
they pray that the minister responsible for canada mortgage and housing will immediately suspend negotiations on social housing with the province of ontario and resume negotiations only if the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles established with the input of the co - operative housing stakeholders .

government orders
speech from the throne
resumption of debate on address in reply
mr. preston manning -lrb- leader of the opposition , ref . -rrb- :
first i congratulate you on your re - election to the chair .
i extend best wishes to you on behalf of the members of the official opposition .
we wish you patience and wisdom in your deliberations in guiding our deliberations and express the hope that the spirit of democracy expressed on the first day you were elected will continue throughout this parliament .
congratulations to you , sir , on behalf of all of us .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
we would like to congratulate the hon. member for laurier - sainte - marie , the leader of the bloc quebecois , and his colleagues on their election .
while we disagree profoundly with the policies of the bloc , we respect the democratic process that permitted the election of bloc members to this house .
we will continue to try to convince them and their electors that real reform of the federation is possible and preferable to separation from it .
to the hon. member for halifax and our ndp colleagues we extend congratulations as well .
i also ask the leader of the ndp to convey our best wishes to her predecessor , ms. audrey mclaughlin .
so often members leave the chamber of their own accord after serving their time with little acknowledgement or recognition .
i ask members to simply join in applauding ms. mclaughlin for her hard work , her compassion and her contribution to canada .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
mr. preston manning :
i congratulate the leader of the conservative party and his colleagues .
i congratulate the right hon. prime minister .
he has had a long career in politics .
we were attempting to terminate it a little earlier but we were not quite successful .
jason moscovitz on the night of the election said that the member for sherbrooke won the leaders debate , that reform won the campaign but that the prime minister won the election .
we would have preferred his victory to ours .
i would also like to congratulate the prime minister and his gracious wife aline on their 40 th wedding anniversary a few weeks ago .
if she can put up with the prime minister for 40 years i guess we can put up with him for another four .
to all hon. members i would like to extend congratulations on elections and re - elections .
i would like to say to all the younger mps and to the new mps that we wish to encourage them .
i think they can bring invigoration and a fresh spirit to this institution which sometimes shows signs of age .
i would encourage all members to encourage these new members and to give them the respect they deserve .
they do represent really the vanguard of the future and we welcome them to this house .
last of all but not least i want to acknowledge and thank the people of calgary southwest .
as i have frequently said to them , this seat in my judgment does not belong to me .
it does not belong to my party .
it is their seat .
turning to more important business , on june 2 over 12 million canadians participated in the federal election .
when the ballots were counted the seats were allocated , whether we like it or not , the way we see them in the house .
it seems to me at the outset it would be important to ask ourselves precisely what did canadians do on june 2 and what message were they endeavoring to send by what they did .
i suggest they were saying four things .
first , they reduced the representation of the both the government party and the official opposition of the last parliament ; fewer seats for the liberals and fewer seats for the bloc .
there is a message in that of dissatisfaction .
it was not enough dissatisfaction to upset the government but it was dissatisfaction that the government needs to heed .
second , the public increased support for three very different parties , the reform party , the ndp and the progressive conservatives .
there is a message in that .
the public is searching for different ideas and different personalities to represent different realities in the country .
that is one the public wants to see , for better or for worse , reflected in the house .
it is incumbent on us to reflect that .
the third is one of the most interesting things .
when historians write about the 1997 election i think this is one of the things they will single out .
the canadian people regionalized this chamber in a way that they have not done for a long time .
if we look at the votes , while reform got one million votes east of the manitoba - ontario border , all our seats are in the west .
the bloc is exclusively a quebec party .
even within quebec its vote is regionalized primarily in the area east of montreal .
the ndp is divided between members in atlantic canada , in the west , but with no seats at all in central canada .
the progressive conservatives have 90 per cent of their seats east of ontario , with a majority in atlantic canada .
while the conservatives will continue to represent themselves as a national party in the house they are in essence an atlantic party with a quebec contingent .
for the government of course two - thirds of its seats are in ontario , with half of the remainder in quebec .
while in theory it too is a national party , or claims to be a national party , in fact in the house it is an ontario party with a quebec contingent .
if there is a lesson in this , it is that this country continues to pay a price for failing to reform the upper house .
in germany , australia , the united states and in other big federations of the world regional interests are expressed in their federal arenas through an effective upper chamber .
when you do not have that one of the consequences is a regionalization of your lower house .
those who think regionalization of this house is a backward step or something that will hurt national unity should join the ranks of those who demand an effective upper chamber to represent regional interests .
the fourth thing that canadians did in 1997 was allow a 10 year old federal party , with roots in the west and proud of it , and with aspirations to become a truly national party , to occupy the role of official opposition and to become the alternative to the government .
as we begin that new role and analyze the speech from the throne , we owe it to the public to share with it how we see this role being discharged .
we see ourselves as having a twofold mandate .
the first is to hold the government accountable , to commend it on actions which we consider in the national interests but to criticize it on actions which we consider not to be in the national interests .
second , we see our role as one of proposing constructive alternatives consistent with the big themes of equality , accountability and fiscal responsibility on which our members were elected .
in relation to the speech from the throne i would like to perform these two functions .
i want to commend the government where it deserves commendation .
we want to criticize the features of the speech which we consider inadequate .
most important , we want to present constructive alternatives where we see those deficiencies .
as the speech from the throne remarked , the 36 th parliament of canada is a transition parliament .
it is the last parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century .
therefore people can ask in which direction it is going to look .
is it going to continually look back over its shoulder at old ideas and concepts from the past or is it going to squarely face the future ?
the throne speech professes to look ahead .
it is important that we look at the reality behind the words .
i see a great historical and political analogy between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th century .
by the end of the 19 th century the governing party , the conservative party , had run out of leadership , ideas and energy .
it had run out of steam .
macdonald , the guiding light , was gone .
the lesser lights , though well meaning , who took his place were unable to build on the foundation which he had laid .
once new ideas , such as the federal union , the national policy or the transcontinental railway , were by that point in time the status quo .
as j . arthur lower the historian put it , the once vital era of macdonald sputtered to a dreary conclusion after the death of its guiding spirit .
while an exhausted government was still running the country , canada itself was bursting with the new ideas , new energies and new potentials of the 20 th century , and while the government was mired in the past , the people started to seek ways and means to express their frustrations with a government whose time had past .
with their desire to see new ideas expressed in the federal arena they started to search for new personalities and new groups .
the personality they settled on was sir wilfrid laurier and the new group of mps around him .
the throne speech quotes sir wilfrid laurier .
he was talking about fiscal realities .
he described canada not as a country led and inspired by government policy but as a young giant shackled and manacled by government policy .
he said about the need for a fresh start : '' i say that the time has come for gentlemen on the other side to cease their boasting and self - glorification and for the people of the country to open their eyes and see that a new departure must be made from the policy which has been followed for the last 10 years .
i have said that a change has become absolutely necessary to the well - being of the country '' .
sir wilfrid laurier on the weakness of the previous government ' s legislative program in a debate on the speech from the throne , precisely like this , said : '' the speech from the throne has been for some years past a very dry skeleton .
this year it is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
i see a striking parallel between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th .
the once great liberal party is running out of steam .
the throne speech , despite forward looking language , offers no brilliant illumination of the horizon of the new millennium .
there is no connection to the forces of innovation and change and reform that are at large in the country which if harnessed to national policy will help propel canada into the 21 st century with vigor and optimism .
i say in applying glorious analogy to this throne speech , it is a dry bone speech lacking in the flesh and blood and muscle and sinew and heart and soul required to inspire canadians for the 21 st century .
i would apply the words exactly : '' the speech from the throne has been for some years a very dry skeleton .
this year is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
with this sobering historical parallel and laurier ' s analogy before us let us analyze the government ' s speech from the throne .
we want to examine the dry bones .
we want to give credit where credit is due .
as any dog will tell you , a dry bone is better than no bone at all .
where deficiencies exist what we will endeavor to do is not simply to be critical but to offer new ideas that can perhaps turn this dry bones throne speech into something vibrant and new and appropriate to leading the country into the 21 st century .
let me look first at the economy .
the government proposes little with respect to the economy .
it mentions none of the resource sectors .
it mentions nothing about the manufacturing sector .
it does mention investing in knowledge and creativity .
we find all the government ' s references to high technology tiresome because the rhetoric is there and yet we cannot even get electronic voting in this house .
let us start practising high tech if we believe in high tech and not just talking about it .
the principal argument in the government ' s throne speech with respect to facilitating economic recovery is that it now has the deficit under control .
when we first came here in 1993 our analysis was that the federal financial vehicle had four flat tires .
one of them was the deficit , one was that spending was out of control , one was the debt out of control , the other was taxes out of control .
we do not think the timetable was right but at least one of those tires is now getting close to being in good shape .
the question is what to do about the other three tires .
in the speech from the throne there is virtually little or nothing on the subject of how to fix the problem of the debt and how to fix the problem of excessive taxation and how to ensure that future spending will not get out of control the way it did in the past .
we ask where are the commitments in this speech from the throne to debt reduction targets and tax reduction targets ?
where are the principles that will guide us on these issues ?
does the government have a view on what is the optimal size of government , on what is the optimal revenue that it should be taking out of the economy ?
does it have a view on what is the optimal debt size for a government of this nature in this type of a country ?
my colleague , the member for medicine hat , has been circulating a discussion paper entitled '' beyond a balanced budget '' .
what he is finding and what we have found for the last three years is that there are all kinds of ideas out there in the country , with the think tanks , with the business people who have had to rationalize these problems within their companies or they would go under , with younger canadians who have been thinking about these things because it is their future that is jeopardized .
the tragedy is that very little of that thinking is seen at all in the government ' s program or in the speech from the throne .
my colleagues in their discussion of the speech from the throne and in legislation that comes before this house will endeavor to bring that muscle , sinew , tissue , spirit and body required to add some substance to the dry bones on economic recovery contained in the throne speech .
let me talk for a moment about the social safety net .
the government to its credit acknowledges that the social safety net is frayed , that we are in trouble with respect to health care , with respect to pensions , with respect to child poverty and in some respects with regard to education .
we agree with that assessment .
however , in the throne speech there is only dry bones , administrative tinkering to deal with the problems of these programs .
the social safety net in our judgment requires a new approach .
it requires acknowledgement that the frontline caregivers in this country , mothers , fathers , families , and services given by governments closer to the people are the elements of social safety nets that need to be strengthened by government policy .
where is the recognition in the speech from the throne that many government initiated social programs , no matter how well meaning they would be , are simply no longer affordable , no longer workable and no longer even supported by the clients that they were intended to serve .
the speech from the throne refers to children but it seems to refer to children as if they were disembodied spirits not connected in any way , shape or form with families .
in fact they are in most cases connected with families , many of them in desperate straits .
the hon. member for calgary - nose hill and other of our colleagues will be advancing some new principles and ideas for real social reform in the days ahead .
we do not just criticize the government ' s attempts to patch up a creaking welfare state .
we think that there are new ideas that involve personalizing , decentralizing and localizing social service delivery that can offer more hope to people in the future .
that will be our contribution to this throne speech debate in the area of social reform .
with respect to criminal justice , we look at the speech from the throne and we ask what happened to the new justice minister ' s new tough agenda on criminal justice that was announced in august .
she was going to do something to tighten up the young offenders act .
she was going to have parole reform .
yet there is absolutely nothing on that in the speech from the throne at all .
the one sentencing measure actually made sentencing easier rather than tougher .
where is the response to the needs of victims of crime ?
i think of the families of the victims of clifford olson and what they have endured as a result of the faint hope clause .
did the government not feel any twinge of conscience in seeing those people watch clifford olson parade passed the cameras on his way to a parole hearing ?
our hearts go out to them .
i feel like apologizing to them on behalf of at least part of this parliament for our inability to prevent them from suffering the pain that they did .
where is the government ' s response to families that suffer and are at risk because of violence and because of defects in the young offenders act , defects in the parole system , defects in the court system and defects in the penal system ?
i think of the member for surrey north , himself a victim of crime with the murder of his son , and how he has struggled and fought to get to this house so he could represent victims .
it would have been better , mr. prime minister , to have not had that section in the speech than to have it there with such a bare bones agenda .
my colleagues , particularly the member for crowfoot and others interested in criminal justice reform on the reform side , will endeavor to remedy this deficiency in the government ' s legislative program by proposing reforms , particularly those that put the rights of victims ahead of anything else .
with respect to accountability , members who were here in 1993 will remember that the throne speech referred on numerous occasions to integrity , to ethics , to ethics commissioners , to guidelines for ministers , to accountability .
we cannot help but notice in this year ' s throne speech that element is completely missing .
in no way does the government accept responsibility for political interference with the somalia inquiry .
in no way does it acknowledge its responsibilities in that area and agree to implement the recommendations of that aborted inquiry .
we see no acceptance of responsibility by the government in stonewalling the krever inquiry .
it was all for that inquiry as long as it was looking into the misdeeds of the tory government .
as soon as it started to get back to the period before that , the government stonewalled the inquiry .
yet there is not a flicker of recognition in the speech from the throne of that desire for accountability , not even a willingness to look at some of the mechanisms that can be used to hold people more accountable : greater use of referenda mechanisms ; greater use of citizens initiatives ; treating petitions with respect instead of parading them here in the house and storing them in the basement the next day never to see light again .
in speaking on the speech from the throne , one of the things that we will endeavor to add to the non - existent skeleton of public accountability is a proposal for making this chamber and its members , not just ourselves but all members , more accountable to the people whom we serve .
lastly i want to turn to the never ending subject of national unity .
i note that the government has made some modest changes in its approach to national unity , small steps i suggest , but in the right direction .
in 1995 prior to the last referendum the government was completely unwilling to challenge the legality of a unilateral secession .
it was unwilling to address with frankness and clarity the practical , hard questions that arise when some province decides to secede ; issues like boundaries , debt allocation , what happens to minorities who do not want to remain in the seceding province , et cetera .
not only did the government not have that on its agenda , but it castigated as traitors to the unity effort those who insisted such questions be dealt with and that such consequences be communicated to the people of quebec .
until recently the government has also been putting all its unity eggs in one basket , a basket with a hole in it .
it has been relying on the distinct society clause to move public opinion in quebec , despite the fact that that has been tried before and despite the lack of support elsewhere in the country for that approach .
that was the government ' s position in 1995 .
as i say , we see now some modest changes .
the minister of intergovernmental affairs , to his credit , is starting to address the negative consequences of secession and we commend his efforts .
the government appears to be accepting some advice from the premiers , although we question this based on the prime minister ' s replies in question period today .
however , we thought there was some movement in accepting the inadequacies of the distinct society clause and accepting the premiers ' view that the language has to be changed and the concept has to be changed .
the concept should be changed by marrying it to the principle of equality and making crystal clear that any recognition of uniqueness in quebec or elsewhere , a uniqueness that we applaud , will not confer on one province powers not conferred on another .
these changes are far too small .
they do not add up to a fresh vigorous vision or federalist initiative to unite the country for the 21 st century .
they are just a skeleton , dry bones rattling against each other .
if the government desires to clothe the skeleton of its national unity strategy with real spirit , substance and muscle , i would urge it to start accepting more substantive proposals from other quarters beginning with the premiers .
let me mention what some of these would be .
the section in the throne speech on unity is extremely brief .
it contains only one paragraph recognizing the work of the premiers in calgary on september 14 .
the paragraph reads :
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine premiers and the territorial leaders last week in calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of quebec society .
we have no quarrel with that .
however , it completely ignores what they said about equality of citizens and provinces , and it completely ignores the subject to which they devoted three - quarters of their communique , namely a process to involve the public at the front end of the consideration of any proposals having to do with national unity .
the official opposition urges the federal government to pay more attention to what premiers and reformers have said on both equality and on public participation .
the premiers ' framework of principles for discussion mentioned equality five times .
in the throne speech the government uses a hundred adjectives to describe canada but it does not make one single mention of the equality of citizens and provinces .
if the government thinks it can develop a unity position that ignores the principle of equality of citizens and provinces and more importantly , ignores practical measures to make it workable in the real world , which involves getting equality into the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers , if the government thinks it can ignore that principle , it will be designing a unity position that will not be acceptable to millions of canadians .
why take that chance on the unity issue ?
we also say if we take the premiers seriously that the government should develop a deeper commitment to public consultation on unity initiatives .
it could start by doing two things .
it could start by assuring this house that it will respect the output of the public consultations the premiers are initiating in their provinces even if it does not agree with all the points that are raised .
lack of meaningful public involvement was the single greatest weakness of past constitutional efforts .
it marred the 1982 constitution .
the public ' s view was that it was after the fact consultation .
meech was just packaged up in a slightly different form .
spicer went out across the country and came up with dozens and dozens of recommendations , not one of which really found its way into the charlottetown accord .
we canadians , in pursuit of national unity , have been like a family packed into the family car trying to get to a destination called united canada .
but so far the only people who get to drive the car are old line politicians and leaders .
but what has been our experience ?
for a number of years we let mr. trudeau drive the car .
everyone remembers trudeau , one hand on the wheel - he was a great cavalier driver - and the other hand out the window giving the finger to alberta and other places .
we forgive him in retrospect .
canadians in the back are asking '' have we got to a united canada ? ''
and what did trudeau say ?
in fact levesque was getting car sick in the back and tried kick out the window .
then we got another driver , prime minister mulroney .
canadians in the back were asking '' are we at a united canada yet ? ''
and he said '' no , but it is just over there by meech lake . ''
so we go to meech lake and we are not at united canada .
he said '' no , it is at charlottetown . ''
we go to charlottetown and we are not at united canada yet .
a little later our current prime minister gets to drive the car .
he drives very , very slowly .
and we are in the back asking '' are we at united canada ?
mr. prime minister , are we there yet ?
the distinguishing characteristic of all these drivers , and every male member of the house can identify with this , they never stop to ask instructions about how to drive .
we are saying that if we stop to ask instructions that the public has good sense of where a united canada lies .
what is even more important is that the public gets a kick at the cat at the front end because if they do not they are going to reject whatever package we come up with no matter how well it is conceived .
what are some of the other things that maybe should be in a national unity initiative that really address where the public ' s mind is at ?
i suggest one of the other ingredients which the premiers are starting to talk about is a rebalancing of the powers and also institutional change .
we had a meeting of our little caucus unity team just this week .
if we had been writing the speech from the throne and wanted to demonstrate to canadians that we had some substances behind our unity proposals , what would have been in our legislative package that might have sent that signal ?
i have a list two pages long .
we would have had a bill expressly recognizing equality of citizens of provinces and applying that principle to the exercise of the federal spending and taxation power .
some day in the house i would like to discuss in detail the inequality that exists in the country with respect to the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers .
we would have had a bill with statutory adjustments respecting provincial jurisdiction over natural resources , respecting provincial jurisdiction over worker training , respecting provincial jurisdiction over social services , respecting provincial jurisdiction over housing , respecting provincial jurisdiction over tourism .
we do not regard , nor do most of the provinces regard , mere administrative agreements which vary from province to province and do not exist in half of the provinces , as being anywhere near recognition of provincial responsibility in these areas .
we would enact bills to strengthen the economic and canadian union .
where is the bill from the government to establish a mechanism to beat down internal barriers to trade ?
this house has the power to pass that bill whether the provinces agree with it or not .
where is an act to facilitate the development of national standards ?
that does not mean we will not have national standards or that people do not want them , but we need a new mechanism for the federal government to facilitate national standards for interprovincial agreement .
i look at the speech from the throne and if i were an aboriginal person i would not pick it up .
there is nothing in it that really addresses the problems of aboriginal people .
where is the bill that starts to decentralize and ultimately do away with the department of indian affairs and transfers functions and funding to local aboriginal governments ?
where is the parallel bill ?
they will never get that bill accepted even by rank and file aboriginal people unless there is a parallel bill establishing mechanisms for financial accountability and democratic accountability on reserves .
where are the bills and motions to strengthen the regional sensitivity and accountability of national institutions ?
where is the motion in the house to amend the standing orders so that the defeat of a government motion does not result in the defeat of the government unless specifically designated a vote of non - confidence ?
that would allow more regional representation in this house than it has ever enjoyed .
where is a non - constitutional senate reform amendment , at least to make the place elected ?
where is the constitutional resolution to at least start the senate reform process ?
where is representation by population in this house ?
where is the bill to get that ?
if the upper house was regionalized we could have genuine representation by population in this house and it would be different in the upper house .
where is the bill to provide for constituent assemblies if and when this country ever decides to completely write its constitution ?
this house is supposed to be looking ahead .
we cannot wait until the day when canadians finally decide they want to rewrite the constitution to start setting the mechanism up .
we should set the mechanisms up in advance .
two mechanisms are needed .
one is a bill for constituent assemblies , the other is an ironclad guarantee of constitutional referenda at the end of the day .
they add up to a canada that has the institutional arrangements to make that practical .
they add up to a new division of powers for the 21 st century .
there is none of that in this speech from the throne .
to add breadth and depth to national unity strategies we ask where are the policy initiatives to address the big regional concerns that are so apparent in this house ?
if the federal government had been truly consulting canadians it would be acutely aware of our regional differences .
i said at the outset that this house more accurately expresses some of those regional differences than many house have in the past .
i was frankly surprised when i first opened the speech from the throne that some of the big headings were not the regional interests of the country .
where in the speech from the throne is the new atlantic canadian economic initiative , one that recognizes that the approaches of the past , the subsidies and handouts and that type of thing , are simply not working ?
where is the economic initiative that uses the new tools of expanding trade , of beating down internal barriers to trade , of expanding trade with new england and of making atlantic canada the gateway to european trade with the american community ?
where is the proposal for public - private partnerships to build roads and short line railways and container ports ?
there is nothing in this speech about the new ideas that are out there and nothing related to atlantic canada .
i ask where is the new vision for quebec , the troisi me voie ? in this throne speech there is no fresh vision for quebec .
with all the new ontario members in this house , surely in caucus they must have been looking for an open invitation from the federal government to develop a co - ordinated fiscal policy to sustain the economic recovery in ontario .
we simply cannot have the biggest government in the country , this government , and the government of the biggest province in the country , ontario , pursuing fiscal policies that are either going in opposite directions or at 90 to one another .
you could not think of a way to hinder economic recovery better than that .
you cannot have ontario with the priority of tax relief and the federal government having the priority to spend .
the danger to the investor is he sees that whatever tax relief ontario gives , the federal government will move in to that tax room and the taxpayer will never see it .
what about the north , our last frontier , demographically and ecologically ?
there is no recognition of the north , no vision of the north .
even diefenbaker had a vision of the north .
he did not have much substance but he tried to get a vision of the north .
the north is completely neglected , left as a distant ward of the federal government , ignored or forgotten .
i left the best for the last , the west .
i ask the government members to listen for a moment .
where is the acknowledgement and the recognition of the new west and what it brings to canada ' s 21 st century ?
there is a new influence for good , for prosperity and for unity emerging in this country .
it is an influence whose strength and vitality in the 21 st century is like that of atlantic canada in the 19 th century and quebec and ontario in the 20 th century .
it is the growing influence of the new west , that portion of our country that stretches from western ontario across the vast prairies and woodlands of manitoba and saskatchewan , into the plains and foothills of alberta , across the mighty rockies to the pacific coast of the great province of british columbia .
the new west is built on the principle of freedom of enterprise , fiscal responsibility , compassion for the young , the old , the sick and the poor , equality of citizens and provinces and democracy that reflects the common sense of the common people .
the new west is exercising new muscles and energy , not simply to get its old grievances addressed , but by offering a new source of hope and energy to unify our country and strengthen our economy .
reform is the principal spokesperson for the new west in the federal parliament .
those who think that reform is simply a protest party or that the new political energy in the west is simply protest are 15 years behind the times .
the west can take care of its own regional grievances .
the west believes that it can compete with the americans and beat them two times out of three if it is on a level playing field .
it demonstrates it every day .
it is an example that can be multiplied in other parts of country .
the west is ready to bring those ideas and energies to the national scene , not simply to advance its interests , not to protect its interests , but to make a contribution to the new canada .
this throne speech fails to speak to that spirit in the west .
it fails to try to harness that substance to the national interest and thus misses a golden opportunity at the end of the 20 th century to harness energy and vigor to the task of uniting our country and making our economy strong .
i conclude by commenting on the the dry bones throne speech once again .
perhaps some would say that dry bones are enough .
i do not believe the government is up to that challenge but prove me wrong if i am wrong .
the challenge to other members of this house , and i do not just say reform members , i say the challenge to other members in this house , including some of the government backbenchers who know that what i am saying is true , our challenge is that what realities the government has failed to recognize , let us recognize .
what values the government has failed to represent , let us represent .
what policies the government has failed to develop , let us propose .
what hope the government has failed to give , let us inspire so that the 21 st century does in truth belong to canada .
to sum up , i move :
that the following words be added to the address : '' and this house regrets that your government is proposing a legislative program that is mired in the past , out of touch with the present , and incapable of leading canadians with foresight and vigor into the 21 st century '' .
the speaker :
this is an opposition amendment to the speech from the throne moved by the leader of the opposition .
right hon. jean chr tien -lrb- prime minister , lib . -rrb- :
mr. speaker , this week we begin the last parliament of this century and the first of the new millennium .
i congratulate you on your election and express to you my high regard for your office .
you bring decorum and dignity to this house and represent its great traditions and the historic responsibilities of your office .
among those responsibilities which you discharge so will , is turning off the microphones when they are meant to be off .
i can assure you that both my party and i will support you fully in this task and the other important functions of your office .
i also want to congratulate the hon. member from parkdale - high park for her eloquent speech as mover of the address in reply to the speech from the trone , and the hon. member from beauce for his speech as seconder .
i am very proud of their maiden speeches and i must say their careers are definitely off to a good start .
i can tell both members have great futures ahead of them in this house .
since i last spoke in the house , we have had a general election .
this is the 11 th time i have been elected to parliament .
the voters of saint - maurice have supported me for the tenth time and their confidence in me inspires me in my public life .
they have taught me that politics is about people .
what i ' ve learned on the sidewalks of shawinigan , at the kitchen tables of rural farmhouses , and with workers on factory floors enriches all i do here as a member of parliament and prime minister .
the people of saint - maurice want a government that listens to them and respects them , and that is the kind of government i want to lead .
parliament opens appropriately as another glorious canadian summer comes to its end .
our farmers reap their harvest and the young return to school .
this fall , canadians , especially young canadians , begin to reap the rewards of what we have done together in the past four years .
when i stood before you in january 1994 , many forecasted bleak economic harvests in our future .
in reply to the speech from the throne i said then that everything that we would do would be '' aimed at rebuilding our economic vitality to ensure that every canadian is able to realize his or her potential '' .
now we can say that we needed no polls to tell us that most canadians did not think that we could ever gain control of the massive deficit that had deeply wounded the economy and canadian self - confidence .
who then would have believed that canada would create 974,000 jobs between october 1993 and september 1997 ?
who then would have predicted that our interest rates would fall far below those of the united states , in fact three and three - quarter per cent for the prime rate ?
who then would have believed that we would have inflation lower than 2 per cent , growth close to 4 per cent and the highest rate of job creation in the g - 7 ?
who then would have believed that four years later all the international forecasters would be predicting that canada will enter the next millennium with the best economic performance of the g - 7 countries ?
who then would have believed that i would be joining canada ' s premiers in a spirit of co - operation in the fall of 1997 to discuss how we could help our youth , how we could improve our health system , how we could strengthen our social programs in an era of balanced budgets ?
by working together , by being bold , by conquering fear and despair , canadians have done much for themselves and for others .
we have rebuilt economic vitality .
indeed last week the governor of the bank of canada said , '' canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face the economic challenges of the future '' .
he said , '' the canadian economy has the potential for a long period of sustained growth in output and employment , with rising productivity and improving living standards '' .
we made our priorities clear in the election campaign and in the speech from the throne .
we will invest in children , our most precious resource .
we will invest in knowledge to prepare canada ' s youth for the technologies and knowledge based society of the future .
we will work closely with the provinces to strengthen our health system following the excellent suggestions of the national forum on health .
as a nation we invested in medicare exactly 30 years ago .
i was in the house when we did that .
what incredible dividends it has paid to canadians , to our economy and even to our sense of identity .
by strengthening and modernizing medicare to meet new needs , our health care system in the 21 st century will yield even greater returns .
i would like with your permission , mr. speaker , to salute the minister of finance who introduced medicare , mr. sharp , who is in the gallery .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
right hon. jean chr tien :
mr. speaker , at the beginning of the election campaign we said that we would spend some of our fiscal dividend on health care .
we will be introducing legislation to increase health care transfers to the provinces in accordance with the recommendation of the national forum on health that the cash floor be $ 12.5 billion .
this means that in 1998 - 99 the provinces will receive $ 700 million more than is currently budgeted .
in 1999 - 2000 the provinces will receive $ 1.4 billion more than is currently budgeted .
canada will remain the best country in which to live because it cares about its people .
these are words that we did not hear in the speech from the leader of the opposition this afternoon .
we will work very hard to continue to strengthen the economy , to continue to create a climate for more jobs and for sustained economic growth .
i want to pay tribute today to the minister of finance for his remarkable achievement in managing the finances of the nation .
i want to tell the house that we will never again allow the finances of the country to get out of control .
we have already begun to reduce the debt as a proportion of the size of the economy .
by 1998 - 99 the government will balance the budget for the first time in almost 30 years .
working together with members of parliament , with the provinces and , above all , with canadians , we have removed the burden on our future that the deficit represented .
no longer will we pass on present problems to future generations of canadians .
no longer will critics say that canadian federalism does not work .
there is a new optimism in canada .
canadians have begun to dream again , and this parliament ' s challenge is to live up to the spirit of those dreams .
now we must move forward together into a new millennium .
many in the house today are having their first taste of parliament .
from my long experience i can say that the taste will be enormously satisfying , of course spicy at times but in the end satisfying .
some denigrate what parliament can do but they are wrong .
the situation today is much better than when i became a member of parliament .
even as a private member i was able to pass an important private member ' s bill changing the name of trans - canada airline .
i worked with colleagues on both sides of the house .
i asked some of them to shut up and to help , and we made that change .
my success was shared with members on both sides of the house .
let me tell you what we can do together as canadians and parliamentarians .
when i first entered parliament , canada faced a major crisis of poverty among seniors .
despite general prosperity , many seniors found themselves victims of inflation and of the fact they had not been able to save much during the hard years of depression and war .
the challenge was great , and the responsibility for dealing with it was shared .
the federal government had an old age pension scheme , but , of course , the provinces had principal responsibilities in health , welfare and housing .
the government of canada worked with the provinces and through parliament used the flexibility and creativity of our federal system to confront seniors ' poverty .
saskatchewan led in medicare ; quebec worked effectively on pensions ; and ontario and new brunswick were innovative in housing .
but it was the government of canada that gave national leadership to assure that the creativity of our individual provinces was shared by all canadians .
today the rate of seniors ' poverty in canada is less than one - third of what it was only a generation ago .
when the un names canada as the best country in the world to live in , it is partly because our seniors now live much longer lives , and are more comfortable financially .
and in this mandate my government will assure seniors ' security for the future .
they are our children and our grandchildren , and they will judge our generation by how well we have prepared theirs for the 21 st century .
election campaigns are exciting for me , as for all of us , because we get a real chance to meet canadians of every kind .
my wife tells me that my excitement is greatest when i am around young people .
the hopes and the dreams of the young are an inspiration for me , but in recent campaigns i heard too many fears mixed with their dreams .
let me say frankly that we have lots of work to do .
with the fiscal crisis at an end , our government has more ability to act .
as the minister of finance said in his last budget , '' a government relieved of its deficit burden is not a government relieved of its obligations .
it is a government able to exercise its obligations '' .
we owe our greatest obligation to our young , the future of canada .
as i think of the hopeful yet troubled eyes of the young people i met this summer , i become even more determined that our government will not evade its own responsibilities and opportunities .
i know , as all of us do , that poverty is an enemy of a good start whether in aboriginal communities or in the urban centres of vancouver , toronto , montreal and halifax .
parental love , family support and strong communities are antidotes to poverty ' s sting but they are not enough .
people also need our help .
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children we are improving the long term social and economic health of our society .
together federal and provincial governments must respond through the national child benefit system we are now building .
during the course of this parliament we pledge to do more to meet the needs of low income families with children .
we will do so by increasing the child tax benefit and we will work in co - operation with the provinces as they invest in services for children .
we have the best educated young canadians in history .
young canadians can go to the best schools in the world , but too many drop out and too many do not find work .
youth unemployment is simply too high .
we will discuss this and more at the first ministers meeting this fall .
we will step up our efforts at offering first jobs through internships and summer placements .
we will challenge the private sector to train young canadians to take leadership roles in the new knowledge based society of the future .
we will develop with the provinces a mentorship program , and we will partner with the provinces and communities to give the young at risk a better chance at acquiring the skills and experience they need .
the more education young people have , the better are their chances to find a job .
we will challenge parents , communities , schools and provincial governments to encourage young people to stay in school .
in my family every spare penny my parents could save went to education .
for my parents the grass was greener on the other side of the fence and education was the way their children could get into greener fields .
even though i was a bit of a trouble maker at school - and i have kept a bit of it - my parents never lost their dream for me and my better behaved brothers and sisters .
their faith and devotion to our education put the spring in our leap that carried us over to the other side of the fence .
today , together , parents , communities and governments must assure the barriers are not so high that young canadians do not make it to the other side of the fence .
the struggle against the deficit was not undertaken so that we could celebrate our accounting accomplishments .
that is what we are going to do .
we on this side of the house , plus two or three on the other side , do not believe that the role of government should be that of the 19 th century laissez - faire state waiting to deal with emergencies .
rather we believe government in the 21 st century is an efficient , effective partner to make wise and strategic investments in areas that really count for the future prosperity of our country .
one of the most important of these areas is knowledge and learning .
it is the key to growth and jobs in years ahead .
that is why , in the last budget , we announced the creation of a canadian foundation for innovation .
with the dividends from successful fiscal management , we made a one - time investment of $ 800 million designed to rebuild the research infrastructure of our universities and teaching hospitals .
while i do not want to scoop the fiscal update of the minister of finance which will be delivered in mid - october , it is no secret that because of the good work of the government and of the minister of finance , we are doing a great deal better in 1997 - 98 than had originally been projected .
i expect , therefore , that in the weeks after the minister of finance tables his fiscal update to be able to take advantage of another dividend from our successful fiscal management , to announce the deal of another one - time investment in learning and knowledge similar to what we did last year when we created the canadian foundation for innovation but on a bigger scale .
this time the purpose of the investment in our future will be to reduce barriers to access post - secondary education .
there can be no greater millennium project for canada and no better role for government than to help young canadians prepare for the knowledge based society of the next century .
as our most significant millennium project we will establish at arm ' s length from government a canada millennium scholarship endowment fund .
the income from the fund will reward academic excellence and will provide thousands of scholarships each year , beginning in the year 2000 for low and moderate income canadians to help them attend universities and colleges .
we will be working closely with appropriate partners to help in the actual design of the fund .
it will not be a monument made of bricks and mortar but when future canadians look around , they will see its legacy everywhere .
i hope it can do in the 21 st century for our economy and our country what the investment after world war ii in post - secondary education did for our returning soldiers , for our economy and our country in the last half of the 20 th century .
on a very personal basis i hope it will be able to do in a different area for many thousands of young canadians what my parents were able to do for me , my brothers and my sisters .
in addition to this one - time endowment , the government will make further changes to the canada student loans programme and will increase assistance for students with dependents .
with these and other measures , to be developed over the next few months in concert with the provinces , we will build on the progress made in the last budget to address the increasing cost of post - secondary education and the resulting debt burden on students .
when i was young , pursuing my education meant that i had to leave home for boarding school .
bill gates has said that schoolnet is '' the leading program in the world in terms of letting kids get out and use computers '' .
and we know that we can , and must , do even more .
as i traveled through canada during the last four years , i saw how new technologies are strengthening rural canada .
we promised in our election program that we would help rural canada share new technologies and we will keep that promise .
it is tremendously important to know that our great country with its millions of square kilometres will be the most connected country in the world by the millennium .
distances will matter much less ; and we will see tha differrences need not divide .
the promise of technology is astonishing but technology must have a soul .
it was very troubled to read a survey this summer that suggested that young canadians knew too little about each other and what we have done together .
according to the survey , in every province except quebec , more canadians thought neil armstrong was the first canadian in space rather than marc garneau .
only 28 per cent of quebec youth could name john a . macdonald as our first prime minister , although 78 per cent of them could name wilfrid laurier as the first francophone prime minister .
too often we forget , or do not know , what we have achieved together .
it is unacceptable that our youth may know all about computers but so little about their country .
at one level , this is why our future youth programs will emphasize exchanges .
i never knew canada until i sat at kitchen tables in saskatchewan , skiied in the rockies , walked on the tundra in the arctic , played pool on fogo island in newfoundland , and talked with aboriginal elders around fires .
similarly , canada touches my heart and affects my thoughts as i discover the grandeur of our history .
it moves me deeply to learn that over 150 years ago , when religion and race caused wars everywhere else in the world , here in canada robert baldwin resigned his seat in the parliament of the united canada ' s so that his colleague , louis hippolyte lafontaine , could run in a seat in the heart of english canada .
lafontaine became the francophone catholic member for a thoroughly english and protestant riding .
working together , baldwin and lafontaine brought us responsible government .
how many young canadians know that just over a century ago as religious quarrels engulfed the world , canada , a country with a large protestant and british majority , elected its first francophone catholic prime minister ?
it had the good sense to re - elect laurier for three more terms , a reasonable goal for any prime minister , it seems to me .
we must find ways for young canadians to learn what they share , to know what we have done and to gain pride in their nation ' s accomplishments .
the government of canada will work with our great museums , other federal and provincial institutions and with voluntary groups to develop ways to increase canadians ' knowledge of what we have done together .
we canadians have built together an astonishing country , respected , even envied throughout the world .
this fall more than 100 nations will come to ottawa to sign a treaty banning forever the use of anti - personnel landmines .
the foreign minister deserves our congratulations for a job well done .
we worked with others of like mind and showed that canada can make a real difference in the world .
at one of the international meetings i recently attended , a world leader told me that only canada could have been the leader in the campaign against landmines .
i most strongly agree with the recent comment of the opposition member for esquimalt - saanich , a medical doctor who has seen landmines tear apart human bodies and who has worked with us to achieve the ban .
he told reporters that the landmine treaty marks the '' the onset of a new era in canadian foreign policy using our moral force for humanitarian purposes .
this treaty , '' he said , '' will save tens of thousands of lives '' .
that moral force comes from what we are , what we have done together and what values we share in common .
canadians expressed that spirit nationally during the saguenay and manitoba floods .
as we stood at the dikes and watched the raging waters we shared the experience as canadians .
my government feels the burden of that moral force in all that we do .
that is why we will take a very broad approach to promoting and strengthening our unity .
when we seek to realize the highest aspiration of canadians we help make canada more united .
i welcome the calgary initiative of the premiers and territorial leaders .
it is a positive and constructive statement and affirmation of important values about what canada is , and what makes us canadian .
the french fact is an essential part of my identity , one that has nurtured me , one that has given me strength and identity , one that has made me the canadian i am .
the message to quebecers , to all french - speaking canadians , indeed to all canadians , is one of openness and solidarity .
it is a message that should be heard .
i welcome the very constructive approach that the leaders of the reform party , the new democratic party and the conservative party are taking on this issue .
i urge quebecers to hear the message coming from calgary and to join in building on it .
the words form calgary should be taken form what they are , an inclusive and timely message for all to hear .
it is an important step in building understanding and confidence .
nothing more should be read into it .
since this is not a constitutional or legal text , i would urge canadians not to be drawn into a legalistic analysis of a statement of values .
the day may come - i hope it will , and it will if quebec ever has a government willing to work for those quebecers who wish to remain a part of canada , and they are the majority - when there is a legal and constitutional text to consider as such .
the words from calgary are an attempt to express worthy canadian values and that is how they should be welcomed .
i pledge to all canadians that we are open to all good ideas to strengthen the unity of our country .
we invite the ideas of all opposition parties , and we will have an opportunity to discuss them either in this house or in committee .
but we will never be hostage to demands that diminish or deny to each and every canadian the benefits of his or her citizenship and our nationhood , our existence as an independent nation recognized by the un .
we will continue to be frank and open about the consequences of what those who seek to partition canada are proposing .
our adversary is confusion .
i am convinced that when things are clear , quebecers and other canadians will choose to stay together because it is the best choice for them and their children .
as i have emphasized today , we are committed to collaboration and partnership with all those who , in good faith , will work with us to realize the wonderful opportunities that await canada and canadians .
our strength , our character and our recent successes have positioned us to pursue those opportunities in new ways to meet new challenges of a new century .
alberta and saskatchewan were not yet provinces .
the slums of montreal and halifax had a high rate of infant mortality than do the modern slums of calcutta where mother teresa toiled .
few canadians even met others more than 50 miles away .
on the prairies new settlers lived in isolation throughout cold winters , unaware of the petroleum riches beneath them .
and yet we knew we had a future .
at the beginning of the century laurier dreamed of that future when he said :
three years ago when in england , i visited one of those models of gothic architecture - the cathedral was made of granite , oak and marble .
it is the image of the nation i wish to become .
out of these elements i would build a nation great among the nations of the world .
we have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements .
our young will do so in the next century .
their architecture will be new but it will be canadian .
greatness may have a different meaning but it will be canadian .
today there is in canada once again a wonderful sense of a country moving , of a country that matters , of a country that dreams again .
for a long time for too many canadians canada has seemed stuck .
now everywhere canadians together are making choices for a new millennium .
i pledge to canadians that this parliament and this government will be worthy of their dreams and their aspirations .
with every ounce of energy we have , with the support of our colleagues and our fellow canadians , we will keep this wonderful country , this canada , our canada , united .
together we will move into the next millennium as a prosperous , tolerant , generous , caring and modern country .
this country will be a model to the world .
we are all very privileged to be members of this parliament .
people see canada as the country to look at .
when we travel around the world we realize that we are the envy of the world .
millions and millions of human beings around the world would give their last penny to share this citizenship of ours .
that is why we have the collective duty to work together to make this country even greater and to give the best country in the world to our children and our grandchildren .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
mr. gilles duceppe -lrb- laurier - sainte - marie , bq -rrb- :
after the last election , we find ourselves in a fragmented parliament , a parliament reflecting the true face of canada .
the bloc quebecois finds itself as the principal quebec party , the main voice for quebec in ottawa .
forty - four members , constituting the majority of the quebec deputation , 60 percent of the deputation in fact , that is what the bloc quebecois represents .
a second conclusion must also be reached : after going after the deficit at the expense of the unemployed and the most disadvantaged members of society , by hacking savagely at transfer payments to the provinces for health and education and at unemployment insurance , now this government has the gall , the indecency , to make use of the surpluses generated by its own cutbacks to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
clearly , the aim is political visibility rather than efficiency for the public .
with this objective , this second conclusion falls in line with our first one .
the cuts to unemployment insurance , the cuts to social assistance imposed on the provinces and the reductions in health and education transfers occasioned by this government ' s deficit reduction have wreaked havoc in the lives of thousands of canadians .
if i had to summarize the speech on government policy , i would say that the word is federalism in capital letters .
in its speech , the government is inviting us to take part in a great debate on the post zero deficit age .
the liberals are proposing that half the surplus go to paying the debt and to reducing taxes .
the other half would go to misusing its spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction .
having been the cause of many social ills , the government now wants to set itself up as the savior .
it will have cut $ 42 billion from social programs , health care , education and social assistance , thus forcing the closure of hospitals , driving thousands of workers denied unemployment insurance toward welfare and causing massive cuts in schools .
the surpluses that will be generated after the deficit is eliminated should not be used for federalist propaganda , but should go directly to reinstating the transfer payments made to the provinces for social programs .
specifically , this would mean more money for hospitals and clscs .
it would also mean more teachers and student services .
secondly , surpluses should go to job creation through a targeted reduction in payroll taxes .
in its electoral platform , the bloc proposed that the employment insurance fund surplus be used to lower employment insurance premiums by at least 35 '' and to re - invest $ 2.5 billion in improving assistance to the unemployed , including the seasonally unemployed .
not returning the annual surplus of approximately $ 7 billion in the employment insurance fund , and not telling workers and the unemployed about this surplus , is a clear misappropriation of funds .
the suggestions i am now making had the agreement of the premiers in st. andrews recently .
next , the surpluses must be used in the fight against poverty .
and this includes improving the employment insurance system , given the deep cuts made over the last five years , particularly in benefits to seasonal workers .
finally , there is the long overdue $ 2 billion in compensation paid to the maritimes but not to quebec for harmonizing the gst , one of the demands from quebec that was also supported by all premiers at the st. andrews meeting .
and only after it has fulfilled these obligations should the federal government think about lowering taxes or reducing the debt .
but instead of repairing the damage caused by its policies , the government announces that it will now use this breathing room to systematically interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
the worst interference ever seen in the history of canada .
even pierre elliott trudeau never dared to go this far .
and that ' s saying something .
the government is confirming its interference in the health field by creating a pharmacare plan , when quebec already has its own such plan .
moreover , after taking over 30 years to partially withdraw from the manpower training sector , this same federal government is now seeking , six months later , to maintain , confirm and increase its involvement in youth training .
one the very few new things mentioned in this speech is that the federal government will now get directly involved in education , in order to , and i quote : '' measure the readiness of canadian children to learn '' , through an innocuous leaflet sent to every home .
and then are we going to have national standards in the education sector ?
are we going to have national exams in that sector ?
i say we will never let the federal government get involved in quebec ' s schools .
never .
the prevailing ideology in the rest of canada is getting further than ever from quebec ' s traditional demands and aspirations .
such hardening is being promoted in an irresponsible fashion by the comments of the reform party , by the actions of the liberal party of canada , and by the collusive silence of the leader of the conservative party .
as for the ndp , it has always ignored the quebec issue , and in fact this is why quebecers have always ignored the ndp .
slowly but surely , through the use of psychological profiles , changing democratic rules , hate - filled internet sites and the promotion of partition , public opinion in the rest of canada is falling into collective beliefs that still smack of colonialism as regards quebec , in that they view us merely as a quaint entity .
this attitude is obvious in the government ' s throne speech .
never before , in a speech from the throne , has a government so directly threatened quebec ' s right to decide on its own future .
moreover , the liberal government is dropping the solemn commitment made after the referendum to recognize quebec as a distinct society , after putting it in a motion passed by the house of commons , and after repeating it in the form of an election promise in its second red book .
further watering down recognition of the quebec people , this government has embraced the definition in the calgary declaration , referring to the '' unique character of quebec society '' , as unique as b.c. salmon , and without constitutional amendments .
if we carefully examine this agreement , it is easy to understand why the prime minister and the minister of intergovernmental affairs were so enthusiastic .
this is the worst it has ever been for quebec . several experts agree it is far less than meech and even less than charlottetown .
the federalists were rather quick to applaud the results of a recent survey on this agreement .
they should not get carried away , because as quebecers become better acquainted with the contents of this agreement , their support will be affected accordingly .
in the rest of canada , we already hear people saying that quebec has been given too much .
there is a very real possibility it will be charlottetown all over again .
the only message sent to quebec in this throne speech is that we should be satisfied with canada as served up in calgary , otherwise it will be plan b .
that is canada ' s bilingual character .
i have only a few words for the rest of canada about the premiers meeting which was held in calgary .
the bloc quebecois has never deviated from its basic principles .
now more than ever , we deem sovereignty to be necessary .
the constitutional impasse is still there , even more so since the calgary declaration .
the main purpose of the bloc quebecois is clear : to advance the sovereignist project while staunchly defending quebec ' s interests .
during this next mandate , defending quebec ' s interests will have to involve defending quebec ' s democratic institutions .
when we came to ottawa , we knew it would be hard , that harsh words would be exchanged .
yet we would never have dreamed that we would have to defend democracy , we would never have dreamed that the federal government would stoop so low as to question the very foundations of democracy .
this best country in the world is behaving like an imperial power looking down its nose at its ignorant colony , which dared to get just a little too uppity on the evening of october 30 , 1995 .
yet the rules governing the last two referendums were accepted by all parties , including the federal government .
a federal government which , let us recall , accepted newfoundland into confederation with a close vote in a second referendum .
casting doubt on those rules now indicates obvious bad faith and , in particular , a profound disdain for the near - victory of the yes side in the last referendum .
let us look a little closer at the rules the prime minister is trying to discredit with the help of his hatchet man , the minister of intergovernmental affairs .
in quebec , all of the province ' s political leaders agree on the rules governing quebec ' s move to sovereignty .
there is clearly a consensus in quebec on this , which the federal government is refusing to recognize .
this consensus is grounded on three basic principles : first , the existence of the people of quebec ; next , respect for fundamental democratic principles ; finally , the integrity of quebec territory .
all of quebec ' s premiers , be they federalist or sovereignist , from daniel johnson senior to robert bourassa , have defended these three principles .
the federalists , in their post - referendum panic and without an argument to stand on , are going after the process , trying to discredit it by all possible means .
by doing so , however , they are the ones discrediting democracy in canada by deriding the rules underlying it .
partition , a reference to the supreme court , doubt cast on the rule of the simple majority , a country wide referendum , all threats and fears are fair game .
under the tutelage of the reform party , the liberal party of canada has chosen not to face the issue .
everything is being questioned with the almost acknowledged aim of frightening quebecers and with the obvious aim of saying , '' you will never do it '' .
the bidding is escalating at the expense of quebecers .
although they are not acceptable , these attacks against quebec ' s democratic institutions are not the real problem .
although they are irresponsible and dangerous , the threats of the partition and hacking - up of quebec are not the real problem .
although it is both absurd and disgusting , the reference to the supreme court aimed at depriving quebecers of their right to decide their future democratically is not the real problem .
this is the root cause of the deadlock .
the liberal party of canada ' s approach has failed , because it denies the existence of the people of quebec people , a people different from the people of canada .
by so doing , the big guns in the federalist camp are endorsing the position of the leader of the official opposition , who stubbornly denies the existence of the people of quebec as one of the two founding nations of canada in 1867 .
canadians are a people .
the aboriginal peoples are made up of several peoples .
people all over the world are divided into various peoples .
if it is good for everybody else , why would it be bad for quebecers ?
i appeal specifically to members from quebec in this house who , over and above their mandate , are citizens who must believe in respecting democracy and above all in the existence of the people of quebec .
we urge you not to be part of the government ' s blind denial of the facts when it refuses to recognize that the people of quebec people exists and is free to decide its own future .
to conclude , let me say a word or two about canada ' s future .
in its speech from the throne , the government is predicting a brilliant future for canada during the third millennium .
it even invites us to celebrate this future success ahead of time .
we see things differently .
we believe that canada is at a crossroad .
then , the government will give quebec the right to decide its own future in accordance with the democratic rules which are part of the common heritage of the peoples of canada and quebec .
thus , it will become once again a model at the international level , with which a sovereign quebec will be able to build a real partnership .
not a pseudo - partnership where quebec would simply carry out orders from ottawa , but a fruitful partnership between two sovereign countries .
this is simply reasonable , this is plain common sense .
or the government can let itself go and drift away from democracy , this has already started , driven mostly by the anti - sovereignist phobia of the prime minister and his minister of intergovernmental affairs .
and this is the open door to all excesses , a slide towards anger and intolerance , towards totally anti - democratic behavior .
this is a dead end street .
unfortunately , it is this second alternative which seems to prevail at the present time , because of a prime minister who is blinded and intoxicated by the arabesques and arrogance of his minister of intergovernmental affairs .
this is regrettable , but i am deeply convinced that in the end the canadian people , whom i sincerely trust , will not allow it .
the government will have to pay a heavy price for having defiled its own institutions .
members of the bloc quebecois will continue to stand by the democratic traditions of lester b . pearson ' s canada .
we will continue to respect this house despite the fact that many members on the government side try to defile it and use it for their own anti - sovereignist obsessions , as they are presently trying to do with the supreme court .
in concluding , i move :
that the amendment be modified by adding after the words '' legislative program '' the following :
'' that denies the existence of the qu b cois people and their culture , which once again reflects the government ' s centralizing vision by confirming and increasing its presence in areas of provincial jurisdiction such as social programs , health and especially education , and '' .
the speaker :
the amendment is in order .
we now have a few minutes for questions and comments .
if there are questions and comments , i will allow them ; if not , we will move on .
as there are no questions or comments , i give the floor to the leader of the new democratic party , the hon. member for halifax .
ms. alexa mcdonough -lrb- halifax , ndp -rrb- :
mr. speaker , as i rise in my place in this chamber for the very first time i wish to congratulate you , sir , on your re - election to continue serving as speaker among your 300 peers .
it is an honor for sure but also a daunting task .
i also want to congratulate and thank the other candidates to the chair .
i know , mr. speaker , that it is your job to create a respectful political climate and at the same time favourable working conditions for all members who are elected to serve the public interest in this great parliament of canada .
i also know that it is the responsibility of the speaker to attend to the working conditions for all of the employees who serve parliament here on parliament hill and in the precincts in the surrounding area .
i must say that over the last year and a half as i have served as leader of the new democratic party without a seat in parliament i have looked on with some frustration and some horror as i have watched the deteriorating conditions for some of the people who are serving us here on parliament hill .
in particular , i have felt a great deal of consternation at the spectacle of hundreds of locked out security guards .
mr. speaker , i know that it is not because you failed to exercise your duties but rather the government has been willing to not only tolerate but actually sponsor first the training and then the hiring of replacement workers who have replaced workers earning barely above minimum wage and who are coming up to a one year anniversary of the time when they were locked out from their jobs here on parliament hill .
i hope it is a sign of better times to come that there is some indication those security guards are now looking at a tentative agreement .
i hope that as we come up to the one year anniversary of that lockout we will instead be celebrating a just settlement on behalf of those workers and their families .
i am delighted today to finally be taking my seat in the house of commons and i am delighted to be surrounded by some 20 new democrat colleagues .
it is certainly true that three quarters of the ndp caucus are rookies , i among them , at least newcomers to this chamber .
mr. speaker , for that reason we will be looking to you frequently for guidance and counsel .
i hope we can expect a little patience as we learn the rules and the procedures of the house .
i am sad that stanley knowles did not live to see this day , that he did not live to see the official return to the house of commons of the party which he helped to found .
it is a bittersweet celebration for us today .
many of us learned of stanley ' s death as we were arriving in ottawa for our first caucus meeting in june .
we will all miss stanley knowles greatly , his warmth , his humor , his fierce unyielding dedication to justice and equality and his unparalleled expertise in the rules and procedures that govern parliament .
we all remember stanley ' s lifelong battle for decent pensions for working people .
stanley would never have been fooled by euphemisms like seniors benefits into believing that a massive reduction in pension benefits was an improvement .
we pledge today to honor stanley ' s memory by fighting any further erosion of pension protection for our seniors .
on this occasion i give thanks for the tremendous contribution that stanley knowles made to the house of commons , to my party and to the people of canada .
on the day of stanley knowles ' funeral , a close long time friend of his arrived at my office .
he brought me two publications that were co - authored by stanley and by my father who came to work in ottawa as the first researcher for the ccf caucus in the early 1940 s .
those publications talked about a more democratic canada .
for me it is a humbling experience and i admit an emotional occasion to take my place in the house of commons , to continue that struggle for a more democratic and a more social democratic canada .
i was born in ottawa because of my parents ' decision to come here and be part of that social democratic movement .
but of course halifax is where i have spent most of my life and halifax is the riding i have the privilege to represent here in the parliament of canada .
let me take a moment or two to tell the house a bit about my riding of halifax .
halifax is often said to be something of a bell - wether riding .
i must say i never really quite believed that until the june 2 election .
but when all four halifax area federal ridings elected new democrats to represent them in this session of parliament , i knew that halifax was a bell - wether riding .
halifax is a growing modern metropolis and yet it is still characterized by the generosity and the openness of a small farming town or a fishing outport .
our maritime traditions are well known ; the courage of our military men and women serving overseas , the resourcefulness of our current armed forces and civilian personnel rising to new challenges .
less well known perhaps is our rich cultural ethnic diversity in halifax and nova scotia generally .
that diversity i am pleased to say is very much reflected in the caucus that i have the privilege to lead in this parliament .
it includes , for instance , the first acadians in a new democratic caucus as well as an aboriginal member from the prairies .
we have the first afro - canadian member of parliament elected from atlantic canada , several members from recent immigrant families and , i would add , the most women ever elected to the new democrat caucus .
my predecessor , the member for yukon , served in the house with dignity and devotion under much more difficult circumstances , outnumbered by her caucus colleagues eight to one .
i guess it can be said that the only caucus that has ever come close to being gender balanced in parliament is the past conservative caucus .
i do not know anybody who is recommending that formula for gender balance .
permit me to quote briefly a favorite passage : '' there is nothing so congenial to lucid thought as a clear view of the sea .
it airs the mind , tunes the nerves and scours the soul '' .
maybe the inspiration of the ocean explains the eruption of self - discovery in atlantic canada these days .
now this quiet atlantic revolution is sending shock waves through the world of politics .
my colleagues and i are well aware that we have an enormous responsibility , a mandate born out of suffering and out of hope .
i want to say to my constituents and to all canadians , atlantic canadians , today that we will not let them down in the coming parliament .
it is gratifying to see provincial and territorial leaders commit to the unity initiative announced earlier this month in calgary , but let me also say that canada is bigger than any constitution .
far more crucial than any notion of equality among the provinces is the fundamental equality of canadians , canadians as citizens , equality before the law , equality of services , equality of opportunity .
worsening our inequalities can only gladden the hearts of those who seek to divide us .
in order to capture the hearts and minds of the people of quebec , we must prove that canada can work well once again , that canada can once again become a country where economic security , sound communities , interesting opportunities and real human charity prevail .
this parliament must focus on rebuilding that kind of canada .
otherwise , the next parliament may very well represent a much smaller and a much sadder canada .
if this government is willing to tackle the whole question of unity instead of focusing on the narrow agenda of those who would divide us then we will work with it for the shared goals of compassion , community and unity ; but that requires that this government do some serious rethinking and requires a new commitment to the real priorities of canadians .
women are the most vulnerable .
it is no surprise that this government has abandoned women .
the first 1993 red book promise broken was that of a national child care program .
canadian families and canada ' s children are still waiting .
let us look at how this government treats its own women employees .
the government is still refusing to honor the $ 2 billion pay equity debt owing to 80,000 women in this country .
aboriginal communities across the country are desperate for economic development and jobs while this government stalls on the royal commission recommendations .
twenty - five per cent real youth unemployment is eating away at our country ' s future .
canadians have heard lots of lofty liberal promises , but the fact is that there are 20,000 more youth unemployed today than this time last year .
the program reannounced in yesterday ' s throne speech will not make a dent for the 410,000 unemployed youth .
a whole generation of our young people finish their studies without being rewarded with a decent job offer and find themselves strapped with a huge debt , $ 25,000 on average .
what is really happening with medicare ?
who bears the brunt ?
the short answer judging by yesterday ' s throne speech is nowhere .
canada ' s most endangered species is a federal liberal politician willing to take any responsibility to protect our natural environment .
i want to be fair .
there is one solid government achievement that we all celebrate .
i want to give credit where it is due .
canada has played a pivotal role in the resolve to eliminate global stocks of landmines .
i trust the government will have the humility to acknowledge the work of so many canadians whose pressure on our own government and others laid the foundation for this important success .
i know all parliamentarians will join me in underlining the singular contribution made to canada ' s effort by the late diana , princess of wales .
the treaty to be signed here in ottawa will serve as a fitting tribute to her legacy and her memory .
every canadian can be proud of this achievement .
i pledge today my party ' s support to further the goals of that treaty and rid the world of all inhumane weapons of war .
the speaker :
i know the hon. leader of the new democratic party is just wrapping up .
ms. alexa mcdonough :
mr. speaker , i might ask unanimous consent to make my concluding comments .
i appreciate and respect the time limits .
these are the values of my party and they are the values that we will fight for in the coming parliament , giving our children the best possible start in life , education and job opportunities for our young , decent pensions for our seniors , medicare for all and poverty for none , a healthy environment for future generations and strong safe thriving communities .
my caucus invites this government to honor that spirit , to learn from it and to unleash it to build the country we all know canada can be .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
hon. jean j . charest -lrb- sherbrooke , pc -rrb- :
mr. speaker , this reminds me of my first day of return to the house .
i sat here and said to myself '' i am surrounded , surrounded by progressive conservatives '' .
what a contrast with the last legislature .
we are very happy to be back in this legislature and in this parliament and to find the voice we had lost in the last few years .
i would also like to congratulate the leaders of the other parties who were re - elected in their ridings and who will have the opportunity to cross swords with all the members in this parliament .
i would also like to congratulate all those who were elected or re - elected , especially the new members who are here for the first time and who are about to experience something extraordinary .
i would be remiss if i did not seize this opportunity to thank , from the bottom of my heart , the constituents of sherbrooke , fleurimont and lennoxville who have re - elected me for the fourth time .
i must tell you i owe these people a great deal .
they are remarkable .
i have had the privilege of representing them for many years now .
i am trying - with some success , i believe - to give a true picture of what they are ; they in turn illustrate quite well what i represent .
to those people i want to reiterate my sincerest thanks and i want to confirm that i intend to serve them with the utmost dedication and energy .
an election campaign is a moment for the country to stop , to reflect , to look back and hopefully to look forward .
the last election campaign was an opportunity to do that .
for me and for my party the last three and a half or four years have been very much about learning more about canada , about exploring our possibilities and about going forward .
in the last two years and during the election campaign a number of things struck me about our country that are worth repeating today .
beyond the walls of this parliament , beyond partisanship , beyond the rhetoric , there are a lot of good things to speak about in this country .
there always was , by the way .
i want to take a second - and it may sound unusual to some members - to speak about our successes as a country in dealing with our deficits and debts .
a very powerful consensus exists in canada for governments to balance their books and get their priorities right .
there is so much consensus that we find new democrats in saskatchewan , liberals in the atlantic provinces , the parti qu b cois in quebec city and even , who would have thought , the federal liberal party of canada have come around to the idea that we have to actually balance our books .
no matter how much they would like to redo history and say that everything was the fault of the previous government , that they had nothing to do with it , little do they mention , because their memory is selective , that they left behind when we came to government in 1984 a debt that had increased 1,000 per cent fold under the leadership of the liberal government , including this prime minister .
their memory is so selective .
this is also a country that has done very well in the area of trade .
thank god we had trade agreements .
thank god we fought and won the election of 1988 and had the free trade agreement that allowed this country to increase merchandise export trade to the united states by 100 per cent .
we fought and signed the north american free trade agreement .
do they remember that the same people who now sit on the government benches fought us tooth and nail on the free trade agreement ?
what do we have today ?
we have a prime minister bent on traveling outside the country to increase trade with new countries .
he is now bragging about his new amigos in chile .
he wants to sign deals with argentina .
he wants to sign deals with israel .
he cannot get enough of it .
yet they fought us every inch of the way .
the good news is that had it not been for these trade agreements that we signed , that we fought for , canada would have had no growth in its economy .
our domestic economy has been on its back for the last four years .
you have to appreciate the spectacle of the prime minister and the liberal benches rising during question period to applaud the government on its brilliant record .
what is the record they are applauding ?
there are more poor children today in canada than there were when this government was elected .
what is the record of the liberal government that its members all applauded ?
it is the record of a government that has left canadians poorer today than they were in 1993 .
maybe they should travel to atlantic canada .
maybe they should stay out of the oecd a little more , move away from paris and sweden or the norwegian countries .
if they spent a little more time in atlantic canada and in western canada they might find out why so few canadians rise to applaud them when they speak of their record .
this is also a country that saw its health care and social spending slashed unilaterally , without consultation .
this was unprecedented : a 40 per cent cut in funding .
was there any consultation ?
by the way , where was all the talk of partnership back then , this great notion of rediscovered partnership ?
during the election campaign the liberals had to back down on health care because the health care system in this country is broken .
the health care system in this country is suffering .
the health care system in this country is threatened .
it is threatened because of the actions of this government and this prime minister and failed leadership .
they are going to be held accountable in this parliament for having done that .
the speech from the throne was the opportunity for the government to say to canadians what it is about this new century , this new era that it cares about , that it wants to focus on .
why did the prime minister go to the polls three years into the mandate ?
we could have expected a canadian agenda .
what did we get instead ?
the usual expressions of goodwill .
how many times can we rediscover youth unemployment ?
speech after speech , and budget after budget gives us these useless , meaningless words , backed up by absolutely nothing , except a measure announced a few days ago , $ 90 million for an internship program for 3,000 young canadians .
about half a million young canadians are out of work .
i think it is more than 400,000 .
that is the great initiative of this liberal government .
we heard . ''
there were many messages sent in the campaign .
one of them at least the prime minister and i would agree on .
he certainly did not return with the majority that he was hoping for .
he certainly did not return with the vast support from all of the regions of the country .
if there is one thing the prime minister and the liberal government must have understood , it is that they definitely did not get the mandate that they were hoping for and that they talked so much about at the beginning of the election campaign .
so a message was sent to them .
we wonder however if that message was understood .
is there any indication in the throne speech that this government accepted and heeded the message sent by the canadian people ?
we were expecting a national action plan , a plan that would set priorities and tell us how we would enter the new millennium .
what did we get instead ?
we heard from a government that wants to repent , a government that tells us it will reinvest money in certain programs .
in which programs will the government reinvest ?
it will reinvest in culture , after making cuts in that sector .
and it will reinvest in post - secondary education , after reducing its support .
a few minutes ago , we witnessed something extraordinary .
this was in 1995 .
and do you know what happened , mr. speaker ?
i see the member for rimouski , who was there as well , and the leader of the bloc quebecois .
they all rose as they did this afternoon and applauded the minister of finance .
this afternoon , the prime minister announced a new scholarship program .
guess what ?
they all rose together and applauded again .
that is what they did .
but we did not applaud , because we were extremely sad to see such a good program being canceled .
what has changed in the meantime ?
thousands of students have lost the financial support they needed to pursue their studies .
why ?
because the government was shortsighted and unable to sort out its own priorities .
what has not changed is the docility of the liberal backbenchers , who rise and applaud their minister of finance and their prime minister day after day .
they will speak up for the people of the atlantic provinces , since silence has reigned in recent years .
this same government is now talking about reinvestments and partnerships .
but if this government understands what true partnership means , what is it waiting for to form a partnership in the area of health , to co - manage our federation ?
this government had an opportunity with health care to demonstrate that it really believed in partnership instead of acting unilaterally .
there is still an opportunity .
the government could still sit down with the provinces and agree to national standards in health care .
nowhere is it written in the constitution that it has to be decided by ottawa and enforced by ottawa .
let me share a secret with the prime minister .
his position on health care is untenable .
he cannot cut the provinces by 35 per cent and then sit at the same table and say to them '' i will run the show '' .
it is not going to work .
the worst news is that it is not the prime minister ' s government or the provincial governments that will suffer .
we await the prime minister ' s partnership .
we hope this time the words will be worth more than they were the last time they were spoken .
the same is true for child poverty or youth policy .
we spoke of a youth policy with a clear objective where every young person should either be in school , in training , at work or doing community service .
the national government can do something useful in that regard .
you , sir , have the power to change the employment insurance system as it applies to young people .
you do not have to ask anyone ' s permission .
all you have to do is work with the provinces -
the deputy speaker :
order .
i know the hon. member is an experienced member .
hon. jean j . charest :
i would be more than happy to address my remarks to the chair , mr. speaker .
as i was saying , the prime minister has an opportunity to do so .
we hope he is sincere in his extending a hand for some advice .
we should all recognize outright that education and training are provincial jurisdictions but the prime minister happens to have some control .
in this parliament control of ei is an important lever that has an impact on the decisions young people make in the area of education and training .
the employment insurance system must be put at the service of the objectives we pursue in this area .
the same is true in regard to the issues as they affect aboriginal canadians .
i was happy to see at least in the speech from the throne an acknowledgement of the royal commission ' s report .
i am far from agreeing with everything that is in that report but we cannot as a country remain in denial in dealing with what is going to be one of the most important issues of the next century , an issue that will test our values .
the most disappointing part is on jobs and on taxes .
the government had an opportunity .
this is a government that could have sent the signal that it has learned something about the last 30 years .
but what has this liberal government been saying to us now that we are facing the prospect of a surplus ?
it is saying that there is new money , that the promised land has arrived , that happy days are back again .
the prime minister and his government say that they are going to spend that money because they have learned nothing from the last 30 years .
this government works on a few assumptions .
the first assumption is that if there is a problem then the answer must be that government has to intervene .
the second assumption is that if a government must intervene it has to be the federal government . '' we ' re the ones who have to intervene , no one else '' .
the third assumption is that if there is a problem we have to spend money .
that is the liberal philosophy .
it is written nicely .
i assume that it is written over the prime minister ' s door '' if you send it we will spend it '' .
that is the way it goes .
let us talk to the real record of this government , the record the government was applauding this afternoon .
the real country with which we compare is to the south of us .
it is a quite imperfect comparison , but maybe the prime minister could explain to us why the unemployment rate in the united states is half what it is in canada .
if something goes wrong during the term of this government it is the fault of the past government .
the government could have offered a different course to the country .
with respect to taxes this government should not put up with the shameless rip off of employed canadians , of the working poor in this country , who are being gouged because the government is using the employment insurance fund to pay down the deficit .
i asked the question in the house today yes or no , is the employment insurance fund of the government being used to reduce the deficit .
the government is paying down the deficit on the backs of workers , small businesses and on the backs of the unemployed , especially young unemployed canadians .
if the government wanted to do something today it could reduce premiums 25 per cent .
are they listening ?
no , they are heckling .
maybe i am not convincing .
maybe i am too partisan .
but do members think that the canadian chambers of commerce is too partisan ?
do members think that le conseil du patronat is too partisan ?
i do not think so .
i hope the government will learn .
mr. peter mackay :
mr. speaker , i rise to ask that the hon. leader of the conservative party be afforded the same privilege which was afforded the leader of the new democratic party , that he be , by the unanimous consent of the house , permitted to finish his remarks .
the deputy speaker :
is there unanimous consent for the hon. member to complete his remarks ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
hon. jean j . charest :
mr. speaker , the government speaks of taxes .
it speaks of trade .
there is all this talk of rebalancing the federation .
a new balance of responsibilities will be established in the federation .
and no need to say that the leader of the official opposition wants a massive decentralization .
however , there are areas where the powers of the national government must be strengthened because it is not by stripping the federal government of all its responsibilities that we will keep the country united .
if this government believes in the real rebalancing of the federation it would also speak to the areas where the national government should reinforce its powers .
believe it or not , this party of mine , the party which founded the country , the party of sir john a . macdonald , the party which was here through good and bad times , also knows that a strong central government in the areas in which it should be strong is the best bet in keeping this country together .
again i will offer some advice to my colleague .
if the government really believed in the strength of leadership it would offer some leadership on interprovincial trade .
the prime minister is going to do another team canada trip in january .
can i make a humble suggestion to him .
when he returns to canada , why does he not get the premiers together and organize a team canada trip in canada ?
this government has the power to say to the provinces '' we will give you a year to sit down with us and conclude an agreement for interprovincial trade with a dispute settlement mechanism '' .
who would object to that ?
surely not the government of the province of quebec which in the 1995 referendum argued under the word partnership the value of the economic union of canada .
surely not those who have signed on to trade agreements with dispute settlement mechanisms with the united states and mexico .
why can we not have this for canada and create jobs as we do it ?
that is also one of the compelling reasons why such leadership should be exercised .
so here are a few of the ideas of things that we believe in .
in the area of health care we think this government needs to move very rapidly .
we hope it will use the opportunity of the first ministers conference to propose a covenant in health care , to recognize that the agenda on health care in this country will not be a national agenda until the national government plays its role .
it is fine to go out there and accuse the provinces of doing this or that .
but they will be out there and canadians will be in a period of uncertainty on health care until the national government offers real leadership , not denial .
this includes recognition of national standards , a covenant in the area of health care , an agreement by the provinces to enforce those standards and also a dispute settlement mechanisms in the area of health care .
in education and training this government could lead the way by offering some leadership on testing in the sciences and math , wiring schools , doing everything in its power to offer access to post - secondary education which it seemed to say today .
frankly , excuse us if we are a little jaundiced , but we have heard the same words in the past and seen exactly the contrary .
pension reform will also be very important .
the prime minister will know that canadians are very concerned , and they should be .
the government has a hidden agenda .
to put it very directly , it is proposing pension reform that is going to overwhelmingly affect middle class canadians .
middle class canadians are going to get whacked by the government .
they are going to be affected .
the people who saved for their retirements are now going to find out that these liberal members are going to take that away from them .
we want the government to come clean .
we are ready to debate it and prepare pension reform .
how will this affect married women who are in relationships where their income will be judged on family income , not their individual income ?
in the area of cpp we continue to support increases in premiums reluctantly .
this is a payroll tax .
but we equally believe that if there is going to be an increase in the premiums they must be offset by tax reductions .
otherwise we will end up with an $ 11 billion or $ 12 billion bite out of the economy .
it must be said that the prime minister knows that , for us , the national unity issue is not partisan .
i think that we proved it in the 1995 referendum and after .
they cannot be replaced .
we cannot expect the provincial premiers to act on behalf of a national government .
i would have hoped that we could turn the page on the post - meech period and finally start building a national , a canadian action plan .
until we agree at least on a common action plan , we will be at the mercy of a government in quebec whose avowed intention is to break up canada .
and we only react to what it does .
the hope i place in this parliament and in this government is that they come up with an action plan .
nobody expects that solutions will be found overnight .
nor does anyone expect any constitutional amendments .
but what we want to see is the prime minister at least agreeing with the provincial premiers on a common plan of action .
i would caution , however , against a plan too heavily focused on quebec , as it currently is following the calgary declaration , and doomed to failure because demagogues elsewhere in the country are going to seize on this and once again say that quebec is running the country , when in fact quebecers do not wake up every morning wondering whether they are a distinct society .
they do not have to ask themselves the question - they are a distinct society , period .
and while i am on the topic , they do not need anyone ' s permission to be distinct .
except that the redistribution of powers , the federal power to spend , and the new mechanisms for co - operation affect not only quebecers and westerners but also people in the atlantic provinces and in ontario .
we will move forward if we can do so together .
that is one of the lessons .
the only person who can come up with that is the prime minister of the country .
but our prime minister , unfortunately , seems disinclined to act .
the prime minister will know that in the cabinet room in which he convenes his cabinet , as he sits down there is something written on the wall in front of him .
the next time there is a cabinet meeting i hope he and his colleagues will take a second to read what is written there .
fear of failure in this area of unity for canada is not an excuse .
plan bs are nice but let me share with the prime minister that as far as this party is concerned they can pursue all the plan bs they want , compete with the opposition leader in trying to be canada ' s undertaker , but as far as this party is concerned and as far as canada is concerned , failure is not an option and will never be an option .
we are happy and honored to be in the house to offer our contribution to the national debate .
we look forward to building , continuing to build what is a great country and offering our children even more than what our own parents left to us .
that is the true test and will be the true test of this parliament .
of all the things a government can effect and decide on , one important symbol is a passport .
who would have thought 130 years ago when this country was founded that as a consequence of the work of these generations of men and women that we would pass on to our children today what is viewed as the most valuable passport in the world , in a world that is globalized , in a world where more than ever people travel -
the deputy speaker :
the hon. whip of the reform party on a point of order .
mr. chuck strahl :
mr. speaker , when the leaders speak of course we do not want to be tight on time .
we understand that the leader of the new democrats went over by two or three minutes to conclude her remarks .
when the leader of the conservative party asked if he would have a couple or three minutes to do the same , we are now into doubling the time allotted for his speech .
i think it is time to wrap it up .
this has gone on now almost 15 or 20 minutes over the allotted period .
i ask you to ask him to bring his remarks to a close .
the deputy speaker :
the hon. member has not raised a point of order .
he is simply making a representation .
the house extended the time and did not place a limit on the hon. member ' s time .
i think the hon. member has expressed his view about what the extension should have been but in the circumstances , i recognize the hon. member for sherbrooke .
hon. jean j . charest :
following the hon. member , mr. speaker , he could just leave if he wanted to .
he does not have to sit and put up with this .
i understand how difficult it must be for him to listen to all of this , but that is fine .
i do not want to dwell on that .
if he does not want to listen , he can just leave .
this is something that we , as a parliament , have a very direct effect upon .
i hope that everyone of us here will make a commitment , will inherit that passport and be able to benefit from what is one of the greatest citizenships in the world , being a canadian .
the deputy speaker :
pursuant to order made on tuesday , september 23 , 1997 , this house stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o ' clock .
-lrb- the house adjourned at 6.17 p.m. -rrb-
