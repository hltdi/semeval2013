Approach:
----------

Short description of the approach:
Our "MRF" model builds a Markov network of L1 classifiers in an effort to find
the best translation into all five target languages jointly. This network has
nodes that correspond to the distribution produced by the L1 classifiers, and
edges with pairwise potentials that are derived from the joint probabilities of
target-language labels occurring together in the training data. We optimize
assignments over the five output variables using loopy belief propagation.

Resources that were used:
The Europarl_Intersection corpus.

Tools that were used (preprocessing, machine learning tools, etc)
NLTK, Stanford Tagger, Berkeley Aligner, TreeTagger (for lemmatization), megam.
